"0"|"statement"|"statement"|"Come on Saturday, a friend in the know said, because that's when the French chef cooks."
"1"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's right across the road when we got out of Mustafa and decided to try the restaurant on a whim."
"2"|"statement"|"statement"|"We headed downstairs after about 20 minutes when we'd had enough of the scene upstairs and took a table right at the edge of the water."
"3"|"statement"|"statement"|"Although that is not what I look forward to so much these days, it does bring back fond memories."
"4"|"statement"|"statement"|"The waitress handling the bill went to get a senior person, presumably the manager, who could only say 'he can't help us' flatly without leaving room for any discussion."
"5"|"statement"|"statement"|"People who know me would know that I don't give five stars very easily."
"6"|"statement"|"statement"|"I mean, food tastes good, but is far away from spectacular, and that's when Epicurious starts losing points."
"7"|"statement"|"statement"|"Rempah Ayam Savoury glutinous rice roll with chicken floss paste Interestingly the chicken paste was on top of the rice roll, instead being wrapped inside as what was commonly found."
"8"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is the quintessential posh and good French restaurant where you have a pay a pretty penny and get amazing food, service and ambience."
"9"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've had the chance to see the SSO perform in the Esplanade Concert Hall three times this season (in a wide range of seats), and what a great venue it is!"
"10"|"statement"|"statement"|"but i try..............  cones, waffles and cups which will i choose from here when will i stop i believe your ice cream brought me here and we should be together, babe you're cold but hot  i play it off, but I'm dreaming of you and I'll keep my cool, but I'm feinding  i try to say goodbye and I choke try to walk away and I stumble though I try to hide it, it's clear my world crumbles when you are not near  goodbye and I choke i try to walk away and I stumble though I try to hide it, it's clear my world crumbles when you are not near  i may appear to be free but I'm just a prisoner of your flavours and I may seem all right and smile when you melt but my smiles are just a front just a front, hey  i play it off, but I'm dreaming of you and I'll keep my cool, but I'm feinding  i try to say goodbye and I choke try to walk away and I stumble though I try to hide it, it's clear my world crumbles when you are not near  goodbye and I choke i try to walk away and I stumble though I try to hide it, it's clear my world crumbles when you are not near  here is my confession may you be my possession boy, I need you much yuzu, granny's, WTFudge with all my might I try but this I can't deny, deny  i play it off, but I'm dreaming of you but I'm dreaming of you babe i'll keep my cool, but I'm feinding  i try to say goodbye and I choke try to walk away and I stumble though I try to hide, it's clear my world crumbles when you are not there  goodbye and I choke i try to walk away and I stumble though I try to hide it, it's clear my world crumbles when you are not near  goodbye and I choke i try to walk away and I stumble though I try to hide it, it's clear my world crumbles when you are not near"
"11"|"statement"|"statement"|"Yowza - the buffet is probably second best to what I've had at the Shangra-La in Shanghai."
"12"|"statement"|"statement"|"Shunjuu is a good place for sumiyaki in Robertson Quay and reservations are absolutely essential, although it's prolly a lot easier to walk in here than Kazu, something we have done when Kazu's two seatings are full."
"13"|"statement"|"statement"|"The only complaint is that it had whole cloves in the rice, which added to the flavor but we're difficult to avoid when chowing down (however I will chock this up to my American tendencies)."
"14"|"statement"|"statement"|"Waving frantically when they looked vaguely in our direction was probably the only way to get their attention."
"15"|"question"|"question"|"Our waitress who smiles like she's having tooth pain was serving us the wrong dish but she seemed like she doesn't want to serve us the right dish  Do you still want your dish?"
"16"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"Ask for soy sauce and you get the most miniscule serving to share amongst diners, water is not readily served, and when we turned up with a birthday cake and asked them to bring it out for us later, they just put it right next to the birthday girl about a minute later rather than keeping it hidden away...?"
"17"|"statement"|"statement"|"I am attracted to overall dark ambience with huge swordsman pictures and their open kitchen when I arrived."
"18"|"statement"|"statement"|"I would not seek it out if I was not nearby, but it's got most of what you would expect!"
"19"|"statement"|"statement"|"I guess this is part of their service to diners who sit at the booths which I feel was adequate for one person to slide in, slowly."
"20"|"statement"|"statement"|"They are hiring a waiter staff (18-25 year old girl) who doesn't know customer service at all, well doesn't really speak English (possibly she is an English school student)."
"21"|"statement"|"statement"|"It would be a different story if this was Potato Head in Bali where you're captive in one club without other food options, but there are plenty of nearby eateries where you could get better bang for your buck."
"22"|"statement"|"statement"|"I came right when they opened, because I knew there'd be a long line."
"23"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is quite unlike most grill restaurants where sides are limited and predictable."
"24"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think the berry compote and the fresh fruits is what made the dish."
"25"|"statement"|"statement"|"In fact, there have been many occasions where I've found myself running back and forth through the Fullerton Hotel - One Fullerton underground pass panting because I confused Jing for Jade and Jade for Jing."
"26"|"statement"|"statement"|"for those who don't, here is your chance to get acquainted with one."
"27"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure what it was, but really interesting practice!"
"28"|"statement"|"statement"|"Although sitting by the road, near a cow grass patch wasn't exactly the ambiance I had in mind when dining at a French restaurant..."
"29"|"statement"|"statement"|"Stefan, who runs the front of the house, is good at gauging the mood of each group of diners, and if you're there for a romantic evening with your significant other he'll keep his space and interrupt you as little as possible, but if you're there with a group then he'll be more talkative, give longer explanations of the dishes and the chef's approach, etc."
"30"|"statement"|"statement"|"The selection is not overwhelming but what they have is all of good quality."
"31"|"statement"|"statement"|"It doesn't feel like your in a laboratory but they use utensils like syringes to add on to your drinks (depends on what you order)."
"32"|"statement"|"statement"|"As you take the lift up to the rooftop where Mr Punch is located, an interesting string of words on the lift door greets you."
"33"|"statement"|"statement"|"It just got tougher because I was recently in Phuket, where the bar just kept getting higher!"
"34"|"statement"|"statement"|"The restaurant is primarily aimed at vegetarians but will veganize even the set menu when asked."
"35"|"statement"|"statement"|"Quite simply, the modus here is: you sit, they tell you what to order, you eat, you leave."
"36"|"statement"|"statement"|"Try chatting up with the owner if you visit the next time, he's a wonderful gent with a well informed viewpoint on food & life...& throbbing passion for what he does."
"37"|"statement"|"statement"|"Went there one night and over ordered as usual (a consistent trend when I have Thai meals)."
"38"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were attended to promptly when we had requests, but the waitress forgot to introduce our dishes at least once and when she did introduce them, she forgot some of the names and said things like err something like shellfish one."
"39"|"statement"|"statement"|"Oh, before I forget, the Coopers Pale tasted a little different, not like what I am used to back home, but still, it was cool."
"40"|"statement"|"statement"|"They have a very unique consistency somewhat reminiscent of what one might use for inseminating the *other* kind of egg."
"41"|"statement"|"statement"|"Would recommend this place particularly to anyone who wants to give overseas guest a uniquely Singaporean seafood experience."
"42"|"statement"|"statement"|"In fact, decor is a key draw here.I was instantly attracted to the eclectic settings when I stepped in."
"43"|"statement"|"statement"|"There was no queue today when I arrived at 3pm."
"44"|"statement"|"statement"|"No need to queue and you are guaranteed a table when you arrive!"
"45"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even when we came early and it literally almost empty, the lady said there is only two tables open."
"46"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had never had a dish this magnificent from what looks like risotto, and savored every bite."
"47"|"statement"|"statement"|"In general, most things are overpriced for what they are."
"48"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't care that the service sucked, I don't care that it was in a hot hawker center, I don't care that there are tons of tourists, I don't care about long lines, what I always care about is the TASTE, and I've honestly had better."
"49"|"statement"|"statement"|"I thought it was pretty shocking that you were allowed to throw your peanut shells on the floor - the only place in Singapore where littering is encouraged."
"50"|"statement"|"statement"|"The live music wasn't what you would expect at a bar either - rotating between Hokkien, Mandarin, Cantonese, Thai, English.. some with accompanying dancers..."
"51"|"statement"|"statement"|"Including 'hot as shit' chicks wings..  For entertainment they have a 'beer pong' table, and that's where the real fun begins..."
"52"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service was excellent as the waitress could elaborate on the type of dishes when we placed our orders."
"53"|"statement"|"statement"|"Then I knew what it's supposed to really taste like."
"54"|"statement"|"statement"|"Pandan is what makes up a lot of the kaya spread...and by golly it's amazing."
"55"|"question"|"question"|"And what the hell have raw tuna to do with German food?"
"56"|"statement"|"statement"|"Those who love long waits and inattentive service would disagree with my rating, but those who have a life and don't enjoy waiting around unnecessarily for their lukewarm dishes might think my two star rating to be a bit generous."
"57"|"statement"|"statement"|"Yong Xiang XIng is one of those hawkers that have made it and who do something so well they only work limited hours."
"58"|"statement"|"statement"|"The kebab platter or rack of lamb, beyti kebab, shish tawouk or adana kebab are my go to options when it comes to ordering food."
"59"|"statement"|"statement"|"The service was mostly bad: when we ordered, the waiter offered some useful information, but was otherwise entirely inattentive."
"60"|"statement"|"statement"|"So sorry to the person who got jipped with my burger."
"61"|"statement"|"statement"|"This ramen spot is definitely a little close in quarters, as you can basically hear what the table next to you is saying--and there's never enough room for the servers to squeeze by the other tables to get to yours...so we had to tell our server our orders across the other table."
"62"|"statement"|"statement"|"The older gentleman who takes your order at the front counter is very helpful and friendly, and patiently explains and recommends different dishes."
"63"|"statement"|"statement"|"What a beautiful property, wonderful management who was very understanding of our needs and cultural differences, and fantastic workers - even down to the baggage check men with whom I had wonderful discussions."
"64"|"statement"|"statement"|"Brewerkz was the microbrewery back when everybody still drank bottled beer like it was the shit."
"65"|"statement"|"statement"|"Ahh I remember the sensation Saveur was when it first opened at Far East, and the queues one had to endure."
"66"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'd died and gone to wino heaven when I saw the beautiful shelves of wine from around the world at very reasonable prices."
"67"|"statement"|"statement"|"Plus, the cocktails here are not to be missed for those who loves drinking."
"68"|"statement"|"statement"|"I finished my cup of coffee and was taking a call when one of the staff approached to clear me cup."
"69"|"statement"|"statement"|"She commented their sauce tasted like what I made at home!"
"70"|"statement"|"statement"|"Ribeye - pricey at $98 but the most perfect cut of meat I've had in awhile Au Petit Salut Assiette - a great entree to share, especially if you're a fan of parfaits   What I didn't like:  The Soya cheesecake - definitely not to the standard of a french style cheesecake, it was watery and lacked flavour."
"71"|"statement"|"statement"|"Jumbo Kebap Combo $38.90 The Jumbo Kebap Combo is great for those that love their meat but can't quite decide what to get."
"72"|"statement"|"statement"|"The temperature of the pizza was not too warm when served that both my friend and I could straightaway bite on it after taking pictures."
"73"|"statement"|"statement"|"From what I read, the owner of this newly renovated stall is Uncle Law who has been frying these for nearly 50 years."
"74"|"statement"|"statement"|"It took a while for the sandwiches to be ready, but all good things come to those who wait."
"75"|"statement"|"statement"|"Was curious as to what these green-coloured concoctions, resemblance of a rice salad that everyone eats in one of the aisles of Lau Pa Sat."
"76"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's very peppery and bold in flavor, which is why I prefer it compared to the others."
"77"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was surprised when I learned that the food has no onions or garlic."
"78"|"statement"|"statement"|"Find another country, anyone who has spent more than a day or two knows you can not look out of Singapore without seeing the ships, that is the nature of the country and the busy port."
"79"|"statement"|"statement"|"I do wonder what the ice is made of."
"80"|"statement"|"statement"|"So I immediately jumped in the line, not even knowing what kind of food they offer."
"81"|"statement"|"statement"|"For those who enjoy another level of fries fried using truffle oil, truffle fries are also one of their best seller."
"82"|"statement"|"statement"|"Kai Garden is helmed by Chef Fung Chi Keung, the one who created the colorful Xiao Long Baos at Taste Paradise."
"83"|"statement"|"statement"|"The atmosphere was hopping with music cranked and patrons enjoying what appeared to be a game of beer pong."
"84"|"statement"|"statement"|"Way overpriced for what you get, service is terrible and the place will be closed in less than a year."
"85"|"statement"|"statement"|"I cannot praise this place high enough, deciding to walk and take the back streets too our destination I had started to loose faith we were heading anywhere, and when we followed the small sign out the back down an alley I was dubious...  Thankfully you open the door on the coolest sake bar in town and are able to grab a drink of one if their more unique cocktails or select from the bar menu."
"86"|"statement"|"statement"|"When I asked for a medium rare burger, I finally got what I had never gotten in this city-state, a medium rare burger."
"87"|"statement"|"statement"|"gives you e strength to fight back when u r attacked by e 'zzz' monster."
"88"|"statement"|"statement"|"I am really picky about my soba since I have been to Japan many times for work and fun and I know what it's supposed to taste like."
"89"|"statement"|"statement"|"Wish I had tried this place sooner when I worked at the area."
"90"|"statement"|"statement"|"Yet when I left there were still only 3 other tables."
"91"|"statement"|"statement"|"The food was great and I tried tripe for the first time (I really wouldn't have tried it unless I didn't know what it was), so that made me feel really adventurous and all the food was really good!"
"92"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service was very quick, the wine we ordered was always topped up when needed, and we genuinely felt very well-treated."
"93"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't care what anyone says, the chef here is just brilliant!!!"
"94"|"statement"|"statement"|"This review is basically for the Sweet Spot stall, and the fourth star is for them being open when I needed them (yes, it is possible to *need* dessert)."
"95"|"statement"|"statement"|"That was the only reason why we decided to eat here because there was a table readily available."
"96"|"statement"|"statement"|"a MUST try seafood restaurant when in Singapore!"
"97"|"statement"|"statement"|"To me, what I loved about Teppei is getting to try new ingredients in small servings within a reasonably priced omakase set menu."
"98"|"statement"|"statement"|"to see what others were eating, and i totally should have gotten a rice plate."
"99"|"statement"|"statement"|"They have a small cafe where you can dine in and have coffee as well."
"100"|"statement"|"statement"|"You can also tell from the reviewers in this website that most of the diners (and people who view the place favorably) are westerners who had just moved in to town and obviously are primed for being chopped."
"101"|"statement"|"statement"|"Well I'm overdue for a review post (it's been A WEEK) so why not work backwards."
"102"|"statement"|"statement"|"Quantity small but at least you are assured that what goes into your mouth and stomach is good quality food."
"103"|"statement"|"statement"|"Otherwise, sure why not - it's just another mall you can hang out it."
"104"|"statement"|"statement"|"Nice place to go to, where you will not feel stressed out getting to."
"105"|"statement"|"statement"|"They take a week on average to get done, and if they're anything like what my friend's got, I'd be super pleased!"
"106"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's a convenient place to sit down and have a meeting when you don't care too much about your food."
"107"|"statement"|"statement"|"I wanted to see what all the hype was about."
"108"|"statement"|"statement"|"it was when we were trying to finish a dish of polenta with gorgonzola and mushrooms, that it struck me how immensely rich everything was, and how easily it can be unbalanced."
"109"|"statement"|"statement"|"Lighting has the right level of glow so that you can still enjoy a romantic setting if that's what you're looking for."
"110"|"statement"|"statement"|"While here with the girls, it took us 10mins to try and get the attention of the waiter just to order our drinks - which in all honesty is not great when you have about 5 - 6 waiters around."
"111"|"statement"|"statement"|"Me and my friend are not experts when it comes to choosing sake, so we described the taste profile and our price range to the staff and they will pick something suitable for you."
"112"|"statement"|"statement"|"Sometimes it's just what you need after a long haul flight."
"113"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, what is truly excellent is their wine service from their in house sommelier (yes, this is for you wine aficionados who need your glasses changed depending whether you have a big burgundy red, or a more subtle Pinot."
"114"|"statement"|"statement"|"Firstly, we were waiting for S who was parking so i didn't want to order everything at one go."
"115"|"statement"|"statement"|"As per its name, one can pretty much guess what they serve... they serve low carb burritos-sized sushi rolls."
"116"|"statement"|"statement"|"You could hear the crunch when you bit into the tasty vegetables."
"117"|"statement"|"statement"|"One of the best when it comes to the famed bak kut teh dish here in Singapore."
"118"|"statement"|"statement"|"The dishes there are not oily so it is suitable for the elderly who don't want to eat oily food."
"119"|"statement"|"statement"|"The other staff who was handling the cashier was also courteous and asked me whether I would need plastic spoons to go along with my desserts."
"120"|"statement"|"statement"|"You pay when you return to get your table and food."
"121"|"question"|"question"|"To that, I say that Singapore is a multi-cultural place with four predominant languages (English, Malaysia, Chinese, and Tamil), what exactly do people want, extended explanations in four languages under every single artifact and picture and portrait?"
"122"|"statement"|"statement"|"No longer is the smiling soup-ladling man with the short hair asking me 'here' or 'takeway' and giving me an extra boiled date, no longer is the nice auntie giving me my brown rice and asking how I am, and no longer do I see the uncle who clears the plates at the end of the meal."
"123"|"statement"|"statement"|"$40 for a three course set lunch may seem like a good deal, except when you consider that the food is mediocre."
"124"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was like if you were born to Japanese parents, and they packed it in your lunch box and you feel euphoric when you bite into it on a cold winter day."
"125"|"statement"|"statement"|"Guess we arrived at 9 when they wanted to start packing up so was rushed through the whole meal."
"126"|"statement"|"statement"|"The reason why we ended up in this restaurant is because they stated that there is a 30% discount for standard chartered card member."
"127"|"question"|"question"|"what type of food do they serve? "
"128"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm not much of a chestnut fan so when I first discovered that there was a chestnut in the heart of this, I pretty much passed on the idea."
"129"|"statement"|"statement"|"Those who cannot do without their daily meat intake can also add beef or pork to their Kake and Bukake Udon for an extra $4-$6."
"130"|"statement"|"statement"|"Burratina is kind of like a ball of cheese where the middle is ricotta and the outside layer is intact mozzarella."
"131"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even after living a year here, and having been to many many restaurants, SPRMRKT items are pricy for what they offer."
"132"|"statement"|"statement"|"The staff seems confused, like the place just opened, and like even they aren't really sure what should go on those tortillas next."
"133"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've been told by a taxi uncle that the curry puffs are why people drive halfway across the island to Selera, but personally they are a bit too spicy for me."
"134"|"statement"|"statement"|"For me, I loved how I can experience multiple emotions when I was walking towards the River just outside of the Esplanade."
"135"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't know when I became such a snob."
"136"|"statement"|"statement"|"One of the best times to go for walks in Singapore are during the mornings when it's pleasantly cool!"
"137"|"statement"|"statement"|"Surprisingly, there was one stall open at around 10am when we arrived and therefore that was the one we got to try."
"138"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were there when they opened but we still had to wait more than an hour."
"139"|"statement"|"statement"|"The service was prompt, almost too prompt, when the waitress asked for our order right after being seated."
"140"|"statement"|"statement"|"my two most-visited buffets in singapore is this one, and melt at the mandarin oriental - which is posher, more expensive, and more extensive; so it boils down to what you require."
"141"|"statement"|"statement"|"Quite pricey for tea ... and when I was at the Ion Orchard branch, they did not refill my tea pot with hot water though my girlfriend said they did so at the Taka branch for her."
"142"|"statement"|"statement"|"Prices are about double what you'd pay for a meal at one of the traditional stalls in the Marina Food House but convenience is king."
"143"|"statement"|"statement"|"The highlight of the meal was what came next."
"144"|"question"|"question"|"Take the first three letters of each word and what do you get?"
"145"|"statement"|"statement"|"They also have a happy hour, for those who want to eat out on the cheap - always a bonus in my book!"
"146"|"statement"|"statement"|"No wait if you go right when they open, at 12pm for lunch and 6pm for dinner."
"147"|"question"|"question"|"It's definitely very pricey but what do you expect from a dempsey joint?"
"148"|"statement"|"statement"|"Honestly I do not kid when I say everything they whip up is good."
"149"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were not too far away, when I decided to open my app and see what was around me."
"150"|"statement"|"statement"|"Where I think they go wrong is by having a menu trying to be everything, when really they should stick to the one thing they do well, and improve it until it is amazing..."
"151"|"statement"|"statement"|"Also, when I finished my meal and said I would pass on dessert, they brought my check and a small plate plat of mini desserts from the buffet."
"152"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think the reason why it is so famous is their absurdly fragrant rice!"
"153"|"statement"|"statement"|"We dined at Cherry Garden one evening where I was gob-smacked that I could enjoy beautiful Cantonese dishes made especially gluten free."
"154"|"statement"|"statement"|"We did not think of asking the price as it was a small fish and honestly just trusted the guy (we've dined at exclusive places where something like this has never happened to us)."
"155"|"statement"|"statement"|"This reminded me why I hardly eat Japanese food in Singapore."
"156"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were served by Chef Tomoo who also informed us that Chef Aoki (of Aoki) and Chef of Shinji has also recently dined here."
"157"|"statement"|"statement"|"The tempura selection is rather limited compared to what i've seen in Japan."
"158"|"statement"|"statement"|"So don't be surprised if a party of two who is behind you (party of 4 or more) gets seated first because only a 2-seater is available."
"159"|"statement"|"statement"|"But it's the perfect place for special occasions with elders who will definitely appreciate it."
"160"|"statement"|"statement"|"The chocolate ice cream was particularly creamy and not very cocoa rich, which was too much when faced with a bowl of hazelnut cream - it was left behind."
"161"|"statement"|"statement"|"As an American who was told that Singapore doesn't have very good Vietnamese food, the pho here put the best pho in Houston to shame!"
"162"|"statement"|"statement"|"Also, when you open the box in the morning, you'll find that the eggy part has an earthquake like split down the middle, not sure why."
"163"|"statement"|"statement"|"We had a bit of everything when we went to celebrate a friend's return from abroad, and while we liked it enough -- we certainly didn't dislike anything -- the hefty bill was a tad detached from the reality of what the food really was."
"164"|"statement"|"statement"|"For those who love this place, good news is, they are going to undergo a little reno in Feb 14 and reopen with a even more hearty menu."
"165"|"question"|"question"|"Ok, maybe so do 90% of their customers but who cares?"
"166"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"dont you think so? "
"167"|"statement"|"statement"|"And the place was fairly empty when we were there, definitely not full house with a line waiting outside."
"168"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just to highlight a few items :  1) Siew Mai (pork dumpling) - F - it looked unappetizing, there was no flavor to it, the meat tasted weird  2) Cheong Fun with BBQ pork - F - zero flavor, and the BBQ pork tasted weird too  3) Egg tart - F - it was fresh from the oven, but the crust too dry and the custard part has no taste  Another female staff was so rude when my relative asked if there was any egg tart."
"169"|"statement"|"statement"|"One of the reasons why I keep going back is for the quality of the food and the seasonal offerings that they'll have almost every other week."
"170"|"statement"|"statement"|"Fairly packed when I arrived."
"171"|"statement"|"statement"|"Come to think of it I'm not sure why I keep coming as it makes it hard to talk business."
"172"|"statement"|"statement"|"While the batter is sufficiently light and not overly greasy, I always felt it's a waste of the ingredients when they are deep fried."
"173"|"statement"|"statement"|"While I do believe this place ranges on the pricier side, the great staff, proximity, and yummy pizzas is what makes me a regular patron."
"174"|"statement"|"statement"|"The beef was tasty but when you order it with the foie, they GIVE SO LITTLE!!!"
"175"|"statement"|"statement"|"american food is not as flavourful as chinese "
"176"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you want the corn tortilla, you have to order the tostada where the corn tortilla has been fried and crispy."
"177"|"statement"|"statement"|"As I stood in the queue, waiting and going through the menu, I realized the biggest issue with Muchachos, at a first glance, is that if you're not familiar with Mexican food, you would have no idea what to order."
"178"|"statement"|"statement"|"Firstly, if you are like me who tends to overlook some fine details, the restaurant is located on the 5th floor of Mandarin Orchard, not the Mandarin Oriental near the MBS."
"179"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've paid more than this for non-Japanese food but I've never been to one of these super amazeballs $400 a head sushi joints like Shini by Kanesaka or Tetsuya's or what have you."
"180"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's very quiet when I go early in the mornings on weekdays and I enjoy the serenity and space."
"181"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think that's completely ridiculous (by which I mean stupendously good) pricing, and it certainly made my parents happy when they got the bill."
"182"|"statement"|"statement"|"In the end, the bill came up to $24 which is expensive compared to what you get elsewhere at this type of ambience."
"183"|"statement"|"statement"|"Healthy and tasty, what could be better!"
"184"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think they have a menu - but I always just tell the waiter what I feel like having, Something not too sweet, refreshing and strong, and they'll whip up something for you."
"185"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm cool to spend money when deserved...and this ain't it."
"186"|"statement"|"statement"|"but I've figured out what she means by not too strong."

"190"|"statement"|"statement"|"People who are expect in Bak Kut Teh will know to order the prime ribs which will of cause cost abit more than the usual."

"192"|"statement"|"statement"|"they serve you what you like, how you like it but all within the reasonable boundaries in line with their tradition."
"193"|"statement"|"statement"|"Surprisingly empty when we visited on a Sunday afternoon at 12."
"194"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you're looking for a little conversation, sit outside as the inside can get quite noisy when the bands start to play."
"195"|"statement"|"statement"|"A lunch and dinner menu will be available soon, so it'll be interesting to see what they are offering then."
"196"|"statement"|"statement"|"Later, when I got up to ask for a cup of hot water and a napkin, a staff promptly came over to help, and brought them to my table!"
"197"|"statement"|"statement"|"And order more of what you like."
"198"|"statement"|"statement"|"The cake was served when we asked for the bill."
"199"|"statement"|"statement"|"I walked up at 12:30 on a weekday when everyone and their mom was out for lunch and I was seated right away and attended to faithfully the entire time I was there."
"200"|"statement"|"statement"|"At the corner of Burlington Square, this was a bit of a hidden gem when I found it."
"201"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"Similarly, when I see all the favourable ratings, the needle of my inner food-o-meter will swing violently leading me to burst, NICE MEH?"
"202"|"statement"|"statement"|"After the two appetizers, we basically told him to just get us what he likes most from the menu for the rest of our meal and we ended up leaving very happy."
"203"|"statement"|"statement"|"Maybe I need to go with a veteran to see what the famous dishes are."
"204"|"statement"|"statement"|"As a social enterprise, I am very impressed with the level of service delivered by servers who are challenged in different special ways."
"205"|"statement"|"statement"|"Woo...I'm not sure what hood Spr.Mkrt came from, but that ain't how it should be done in the service industry!"
"206"|"statement"|"statement"|"The coffee was average - not comparable to what we just had at Liberty coffee, it is your run-of-the-mill latte."
"207"|"rhetoric"|"rhetoric"|"That doesn't come across well to customers, why not just print new menus??"
"208"|"statement"|"statement"|"We always visit Yhangtai Palace when we stay at Intercontinental Hotel in Bugis, Singapore."
"209"|"statement"|"statement"|"You get 4 kinds of chutneys no matter what you order."
"210"|"statement"|"statement"|"I adore what they did with their new interior!"
"211"|"question"|"question"|"Oh my gawd, where do I even start?"
"212"|"statement"|"statement"|"Little did I know she frequented this restaurant when I was a way on business trip or in School."
"213"|"statement"|"statement"|"Our waiter gave us a whopping 2 seconds before asking what we wanted."
"214"|"statement"|"statement"|"Personally, from what I see, those wings were overpriced."
"215"|"statement"|"statement"|"Be prepared to be assertive, don't expect to be looked after, don't be afraid to ask twice or more for what you need!"
"216"|"statement"|"statement"|"Still, I get the sense that there aren't many vegetarians in Singapore, that's why I think the restaurant was on the emptier side even though the restaurant is nice and spacious, especially for a restaurant in Chinatown!"
"217"|"statement"|"statement"|"My favorite Japanese restaurant when it comes to shabu shabu, Zen Japanese offers high quality ingredients at reasonable prices."
"218"|"statement"|"statement"|"PARTING THOUGHT: they should install a THW live line cam, so you can plan when to go!"
"219"|"statement"|"statement"|"They also have free flow of water on each table which is a very good thing for someone like me who needs to drink a lot of water with her food."
"220"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service: The girl who worked there was really nice and shared a lot about the cats at the cafe."
"221"|"statement"|"statement"|"Unlike Koo Kee where you can't pick the yong tau foo in your bowl, you pick your main dish at Gao Ji for $3.90-5.90 each and can add on a side of brown rice, seaweed soup and vegetables for $1.90."
"222"|"statement"|"statement"|"Their greed curry and fried rice are acceptable, still edible..   What killed them was the service."
"223"|"statement"|"statement"|"The service was fast and English Premier League football was on, so I was able to catch up what I missed from the day before."
"224"|"statement"|"statement"|"Prices here are very reasonable for what they are."
"225"|"statement"|"statement"|"The food is not bad but a tad bit on the pricey side so I do only eat here when my hunger coincides with an intense need for coffee."
"226"|"statement"|"statement"|"The place was pretty packed when we went at 1300hrs for lunch, and because we didn't make reservations, we were asked to come back at 1400hrs (SO, DO CALL IN BEFORE DROPPING BY!)."
"227"|"statement"|"statement"|"A worthy mention is the drinks counter, separate from the food counters, where you can purchase fresh fruit juice, so fresh it's prepared right in front of you."
"228"|"statement"|"statement"|"It doesn't hurt that this place is two minutes away from where I live."
"229"|"statement"|"statement"|"The set up is simple, there is a huge counter where you order and get your food and drinks and then a few tables and chairs against the wall and filling up the rest of the limited space."
"230"|"statement"|"statement"|"Come to think about it, it sounds a bit twisted that we have to dip chicken meat into chicken egg yolk...... anyway, back to reviewing... this dish alone may be why I chose to gave this establishment 4 stars.. because this dish is not only unique, it's DELICIOUS."
"231"|"statement"|"statement"|"Run by a group of aunties who are always cheerful and efficient."
"232"|"statement"|"statement"|"Please try the one at Ion food republic Scotts Beef Noodles where the gravy is full of flavor and the meat cook to a medium rare."
"233"|"statement"|"statement"|"Didnt know what I was eating but all goiod."
"234"|"statement"|"statement"|"The food selection here is quite limited, but what I want to highlight is the hygiene."
"235"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service is quick and sincere since it seems to be run by a couple who actually owns the place, and parking is cheap too!"
"236"|"statement"|"statement"|"I met a dear Friend who recently moved to Singapore for a glass of wine at Wine Connection."
"237"|"statement"|"statement"|"This location is tucked away at the end of Ann Siang Rd on the left, with only a little sign signaling you've come to the right place when approached from that direction."
"238"|"statement"|"statement"|"and its really helpful where they have valet parking ."
"239"|"statement"|"statement"|"As I was getting hungry to, why not see what is so special with pricey coffee."
"240"|"statement"|"statement"|"I like when people give me free stuff."
"241"|"statement"|"statement"|"Fantastic products from all around the world, a great selection of beef, mainly from Australia and New Zealand, they also sell dry aged beef, which I can't think of anyone else in Singapore who is selling this incredible product, worth every cent!!"
"242"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is especially so when you need nice food on Mondays, where a lot of stalls tend not to be open."
"243"|"rhetoric"|"rhetoric"|"So why the f**k do half of my group consistently have to wait sometimes 10-15 mins for their food to come out after the first plates are laid on our table (getting cold)??"
"244"|"statement"|"statement"|"My favorites so far are the Cow King and the Bird, and what I really love about this place is that you can choose whatever type of bagel you want for the bagelwiches."
"245"|"statement"|"statement"|"We initially thought that S$20/piece was a little inflated, but what came out on the plate looked like lobsters."
"246"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, considering that this IS Marina Bay Sands where you pay $10 for chicken rice and $27 for a Margherita pizza."
"247"|"question"|"statement"|"Recommend where to go for nasi biryani"
"248"|"statement"|"statement"|"Sabio, located in the increasingly hip Duxton area, is a bar I go to when I want a cheap pint of beer when I'm hanging out in the area."
"249"|"statement"|"statement"|"But what a treat the meat was tender and flavorful and came with three dipping sauces."
"250"|"statement"|"statement"|"The service we received however, is what made me dock a star."
"251"|"statement"|"statement"|"We stumbled upon Nana's and it was just what the doctor ordered."
"252"|"statement"|"statement"|"Every Wednesday night after my meeting down the road, I head over to Spizza where they have my corner table waiting for me and my laptop."
"253"|"statement"|"statement"|"a plastic bag is not counted as take-away "
"254"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is probably why there were two mackerel dishes."
"255"|"statement"|"statement"|"Would be great if Vatos increased the tortilla sizes to help customers feel like they were getting what they paid for   Overall great food in a casual fun ambiance."
"256"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't care that there are other late night options in Singapore, such as Geylang and what have you."
"257"|"statement"|"statement"|"I prefer it over Mex Out in China Square and need to check out Muchachos again to see where they stand in the mix."
"258"|"statement"|"statement"|"And sure enough, that's what we got, but it was completely awesome - the leeks were grilled perfectly and sweet and tender, while the hazelnuts provided an excellent counter, and all swimming in a rich yummy bath of brown butter."
"259"|"statement"|"statement"|"It would be a pity not to try the deep-fried scallops (2 for $12), especially when they are at their freshest and best condition this time of the year."
"260"|"statement"|"statement"|"Thankfully, I happen to be part of the vacation-ing class of Singaporeans who have nothing better to do on a Monday at lunchtime than to indulge in some authentic ma la hot pot."
"261"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm a huge huge fan of KL kin kin chili pan mee (used to love the one at mcpherson but it sucks now), and so when I saw that there was another one in another area I decided to check it out."
"262"|"statement"|"statement"|"Great service, good food and when it comes to the bill, no additional service charge or GST."
"263"|"statement"|"statement"|"I still haven't figured out why the ladies' bento sets were larger than most other sets."
"264"|"statement"|"statement"|"Though I'm someone who enjoys the freshness of consuming cod fish, the style of its preparation was not to my liking  Amazing ending to the meal with a good dessert that kind of act as a palate cleanser to the seafood dish earlier on."
"265"|"statement"|"statement"|"But me, I like to see a preview of what I'm ordering."
"266"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even when dipped in the chutney, still not satisfying."
"267"|"statement"|"statement"|"For those who don't know me, I'm not the biggest Indian Cuisine fan in the world."
"268"|"statement"|"statement"|"Sashimi lovers know that the fish is good when it literally melts in your mouth."
"269"|"statement"|"statement"|"The $100 bill is worth trying out a Michelin-3 star's cousin after all.Thanks to the Alsatian born chef; Stephane Istel who manned the stove at the MBS outlet, I had a memorable bistronomic affair altogether."
"270"|"statement"|"statement"|"Overall the ramen were much better than what I had during my last visit."
"271"|"statement"|"statement"|"No one knew but Nik T. knew well and immediately let the manager know about it - who switched it over quickly."
"272"|"statement"|"statement"|"Mixed with fish paste, prawn and what I thought was bamboo shoots, the otah here is delightful."
"273"|"statement"|"statement"|"Excellent service, friendly staff who were helpful with their recommendations."
"274"|"statement"|"statement"|"The rosti was soggy rather than crispy, and came with a measly dollop of sour cream (though they gave us more when we asked for it)."
"275"|"statement"|"statement"|"The wait staff was polite and obliging to give me a table near the corner of the restaurant when I turned down his offer on the small table next to the entrance, neither a bar counter seat is welcoming, I told myself."
"276"|"statement"|"statement"|"Singaporeans who are used to the buffet scene here might be disappointed that some of the popular buffet elements have been opted out of here - no seafood or sushi for starters and no towering chocolate fountain."
"277"|"statement"|"statement"|"For the casual dinner who has the sudden craving for pancakes and are lazy to make their own, or if you're past McD's breakfast timings, then you're in luck."
"278"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just unfortunate those who had the sandwiches, burgers or breakfast selection did not enjoyed it."
"279"|"statement"|"statement"|"Unlike some of the other hainanese curry joints, who fry their pork chops to death, Loo's pork chops are really good!"
"280"|"statement"|"statement"|"And that's how I discovered Poulet when I was there one day."
"281"|"statement"|"statement"|"One of the rare times when I would say yes to having Jap food."
"282"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think they took what is already a borderline mediocre chain restaurant in the US and made the portions smaller and the prices higher."
"283"|"statement"|"statement"|"Wild Honey in Mandarin Gallery is one of these places that seems to be extremely popular with a lot of people and when I finally visit I can just not really get what all the fuss is about."
"284"|"statement"|"statement"|"There is ALOT of vegetables, not unlike what you get from bario at ramen challenge, bugis."
"285"|"statement"|"statement"|"I feel like it's a tad expensive for what they offer because I don't find anything unique about the place for that pricing."
"286"|"statement"|"statement"|"So do give her rojak a try when you are there, it's situated next to the BBQ chicken wing store.. she should be there reading a newspaper or a magazine when you walked by her store."
"287"|"statement"|"statement"|"The waitress looked flustered and proceeded towards the back of the restaurant to have a heated exchange with another waitress...then they proceeded to area of the open kitchen where the orders were placed...  Much to everyone's collective dismay, the orders were not neatly organized by time or order, but rather they were in a huge pile!"
"288"|"statement"|"statement"|"when queried, another staff came over and said, it's like that and that's why we have a tray!"
"289"|"statement"|"statement"|"You don't get to watch this performance very often these days because they gotta be fast when serving the drinks."
"290"|"statement"|"statement"|"Chicken Cheese Arabiki Sausages ($8) Smoky chicken cheese arabiki sausages with sambal mayo Beware of the hot burst of cheese when you bite."
"291"|"statement"|"statement"|"because that's what it tastes like."
"292"|"question"|"question"|"do they have any promotions? "
"293"|"statement"|"statement"|"Overall, this restaurant is worth a visit, however, with it being this good, there's a reason why it didn't get a 5* from me."
"294"|"statement"|"statement"|"A very wonderful server (I think named Edward who can def find a better place to work with his warm character) asked if we would still like our food as there had been a problem in the kitchen."
"295"|"statement"|"statement"|"I also had a latte, which tasted pretty standard which is what I was looking for."
"296"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, when not at the table, they would stand around chatting to each other."
"297"|"statement"|"statement"|"Rather heavy, almost bitter, not for those who usually stick to sweet treats."
"298"|"statement"|"statement"|"Furthermore, the dining area is quite loud because the entire staff shouts at everyone who walks in the door."
"299"|"statement"|"statement"|"No matter what your taste, at $10 a drink, you'll find that things look pleasant after awhile."
"300"|"question"|"question"|"), long queues, may get nagged at at the aunty who directs diners to tables and cleans tables, iced lotus tea that tastes like soap and did I mention to salty broth?!"
"301"|"statement"|"statement"|"I want to eat chicken with Indian spices"
"302"|"statement"|"statement"|"One thing I liked about the chicken rice ... they gave me a bowl of soup even when my order was for to-go."
"303"|"statement"|"statement"|"Only reason why I came here is because it was the closest place for a coffee and my friend was in a pinch for time."
"304"|"statement"|"statement"|"A drink that we fell in love with when we are in Melbourne, it is difficult to find this drink in Singapore but recently it is getting more popular and we are so glad."
"305"|"statement"|"statement"|"We sampled several different tacos and they were all good but everything does however feel slightly like a rip off as prices are too high for what they are serving."
"306"|"statement"|"statement"|"So when one opened in Tiong Bahru, I was very happy about it."
"307"|"statement"|"statement"|"Opened by Chef Yamashita, who is Japanese, it is a French-Japanese cake shop that has the most delicate and exquisite cakes."
"308"|"statement"|"statement"|"Probably, on a discount day, when invited by a friend."
"309"|"statement"|"statement"|"Slightly higher than its competitors  Location: Not a bad location but hard to find if you don't know where you're going  Food: Limited variety."
"310"|"statement"|"statement"|"The flavours were not too far off mark and the desserts were actually pretty good and rather creative when they rolled around."
"311"|"statement"|"statement"|"The service can vary when they get busy, but the upside is - there's no service charge."
"312"|"statement"|"statement"|"I really don't understand why everyone rated this place 5 stars because everything just tasted average."
"313"|"statement"|"statement"|"No matter though, this meant we got to chat with the bartender (Louis, who is awesome)."
"314"|"statement"|"statement"|"On a related note, I am always delighted when served by one particular preparer at this location because he always tops up the mango chicken if he thinks the first preparer has been a little too stingy."
"315"|"statement"|"statement"|"Came here for brunch with my husband and one of his friends since it's right around the corner from where we live."
"316"|"statement"|"statement"|"which isn't exactly helpful when you have NO idea of where to go."
"317"|"statement"|"statement"|"The salad was just okay, I think I can make better salad lol Can't remember what the white sauce on the pasta was but the prawns were really fresh!"
"318"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were served three chairs and only one miserable table to share when their area aint even crowded at all."
"319"|"statement"|"statement"|"Chef Anna shares with us her experience in Spain and what delicious food she has tried over there."
"320"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's definitely overpriced, but i look forward to checking out their brunch or dinner service when i visit again"
"321"|"statement"|"statement"|"Imagine my pleasant surprise when it's closing time, and my sad puppy eyes yield the last scoops of gelato for the day."
"322"|"statement"|"statement"|"Did not understand and even argued with us when we asked to split our check."
"323"|"statement"|"statement"|"We knew it was a bad sign when our drinks came and we could not taste any alcohol in it."
"324"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was quite surprising and funny to see how wrong we were on some dishes and satisfying when you are right."
"325"|"statement"|"statement"|"The gold is sub-par, they make you crack your own eggs, and it's just not a shiok as what OTHER places can offer you."
"326"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had the sliced beef pho, while a little bland initially it's was spectacular when I added a little extra siracha and soy, which I prefer to it having been to salty or spicy to begin with."
"327"|"statement"|"statement"|"The English Breakfast was very good and I highly recommend that to anyone that finds themselves in a situation where they just simply can not decide."
"328"|"statement"|"statement"|"Pretty sad that they try to nickel and dime you when it's usually something that accomapnies desserts in course meals."
"329"|"statement"|"statement"|"we got introduced to ippudo through one of our friends who raved about the pork bun.. i'd skip it here since the meat it cut pretty thin and it was just mainly sauce on a bun..   nevertheless.. if you do come here.. get the ramen... it's pretty damn good.. pricy for a bowl of noodles.. but it's definitely quality stuff.. the broth is truly flavorful"
"330"|"statement"|"statement"|"Then I asked that, hypothetically, what if I wanted to buy the ten or twelve slices that would consist of a cake, could he serve them to me."
"331"|"statement"|"statement"|"brought the old folks here... good simple fare that's good value for money (relatively speaking that is... this is after all Singapore, where food & wine costs have outstripped that in Europe and NY now)."
"332"|"statement"|"statement"|"You pay hell a lot more than what you will be eating if you lose it."
"333"|"statement"|"statement"|"So my sis, my kid and I all got what we wanted!"
"334"|"statement"|"statement"|"EFFICIENCY LADIES AND GENTS IS THE NAME OF THE GAME WHEN GOING TO MOST PLACES IN SINGAPORE."
"335"|"statement"|"statement"|"After eating there, I still think it's kind of pretentious, but when you create food and experiences this good, you have license to be pretentious every now and then."
"336"|"statement"|"statement"|"The staff were kind and often offered to change our plates, bring new napkins and what not."
"337"|"statement"|"statement"|"Arguably, I've never been to Vietnam so maybe I am not entitled for having an opinion on how Vietnamese food should taste but I have spend considerable parts of my life eating Pho both at my Vietnamese friends homes and in Vietnamese restaurants in Paris, SoCal and Philly, all of which have sizeable Vietnamese communities so sue me for having an opinion... Or send me a message if you know where to get a delicious Bun Bo Hue or Pho in Singapore!"
"338"|"statement"|"statement"|"The fella who has gotten the last piece, must be gloating now."
"339"|"statement"|"statement"|"With all the buzz of Wisma Atria's Japanese Gourmet town going around, I knew I had to give it a try and what better day and way than for my birthday."
"340"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm a huge fan of the Mozza in LA which is why when we were in Singapore, we had to try this location."
"341"|"statement"|"statement"|"The line was not long when I was there but there was a constant flow of people going here and for the price it would be a place I could consider returning to."
"342"|"statement"|"statement"|"In fact, our server asked us about how the food was, and what we thought about the taco (quality, price, etc)."
"343"|"question"|"question"|"Could you suggest soem restaurants with good vibe?"
"344"|"statement"|"statement"|"Receipt: $237.65  http://tinyurl.com/c86voa4  When prepared at home, all of the meats were as good as they looked."
"345"|"statement"|"statement"|"But if you do want something off menu or what is special that day, just ask."
"346"|"statement"|"statement"|"This makes me think though that they're struggling to keep up with demand and may be watering down the soup (inexcusable, I agree) when it's busy."
"347"|"question"|"question"|"So what if this place is for tourists?"
"348"|"question"|"question"|"To give you a better idea of what tapsilog is, here is a picture of the Tapa King set: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tapa-king-singapore?select=s1yDWSvTbysL2Ld_as_REw#s1yDWSvTbysL2Ld_as_REw  There are many variations in this dish and are a part of the SILOG family."
"349"|"statement"|"statement"|"Lime's offerings are great for people who like to graze."
"350"|"statement"|"statement"|"There is even a teppanyaki room behind where the chef also uses the place to cook the meat for other dishes."
"351"|"statement"|"statement"|"The menu had changed alot from what I last had."
"352"|"statement"|"statement"|"For someone like me who hates the taste of duck, I polished it off right down to the bone, so I'll say it's swell."
"353"|"statement"|"statement"|"I won't repeat what others have said about the unique nature of this place."
"354"|"statement"|"statement"|"Many other reviews are from people who noticed food on the menu, but didn't order it, opting only for drinks instead."
"355"|"statement"|"statement"|"When you order at the register, you give them your name and they'll holler for you when your order is ready."
"356"|"statement"|"statement"|"Beautifully decorated and it's a WOW, everything must try when i get to the restaurant."
"357"|"statement"|"statement"|"In the midst of all the activity, Praelum Wine Bistro stands out as a place where you can split a bottle of wine between friends, and while the night away."
"358"|"statement"|"statement"|"The distinct barbequed/grilled taste had me at the first bite and will be what I'm returning for!"
"359"|"statement"|"statement"|"I love the storefront with the large square communal table where people just sit there going on about their own business."
"360"|"statement"|"statement"|"One has to wonder why one would need to go to Delhi, when you have this shop in Balestier."
"361"|"statement"|"statement"|"Look, the big tip for this place is to listen to what they are pimping that evening and order that."
"362"|"statement"|"statement"|"this place is kinda cute - you pick a flavor (or a few) of ice cream, choose some toppings from their diabetically-inducing large spread of throw-ins, and then they smash everything up together on a cold stone (oh, hey, that's where it gets it's name) before smooshing the mess for your dining pleasure."
"363"|"statement"|"statement"|"The prices are decent for beers during happy hour and they also have a English pub feel when you sit inside."
"364"|"statement"|"statement"|"That all said though, it's easy to see why there's such a long queue."
"365"|"statement"|"statement"|"But when I asked to swap a potato salad for French fries on a Ham&cheese sandwich I was told not possible as French fries is a side order."
"366"|"statement"|"statement"|"But I am not in California and I have to adjust my expectations to where I'm at."
"367"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, I am left with figuring out what I actually ate."
"368"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had myself the recommended Jia Xiang Mee for $6.40, which is about twice what you might pay in a hawker centre for similar sort of noodle."
"369"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just to find this place, you need to walk to through the Robinson's in the Heeren and ask around to where you will find what looks like a backdoor to nowhere only to find a beautiful and sleek modern restaurant."
"370"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think when eating here, if you start out with the foie gras and black truffle dumplings it changes the taste and mood for your other dishes."
"371"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was told about the nitro coffee and was excited to try this creation, however when I received my coffee from the unfriendly lady (got a dollar - no please, no thank you) it was bitter, the glass it was served in was not filled to the top (use smaller glasses if you need to)."
"372"|"statement"|"statement"|"The cheesy crispy sandwich was delicious when dipped with the tangy tomato soup."
"373"|"statement"|"statement"|"The location is a bit hidden as it is on the 2nd level of Orchard Shopping Center, it is where Lei Garden used to be."
"374"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have been advised to remind the kitchen to start preparing the souffl? when I was half way into my main course."
"375"|"statement"|"statement"|"For those who are on a smaller budget, you can check out the cafe instead, which has a pretty good cuppa coffee as well."
"376"|"statement"|"statement"|"There's plenty of seating, even when there is a long line at the counter."
"377"|"statement"|"statement"|"For me, that is what a typical teh is."
"378"|"statement"|"statement"|"We did a little shopping at Great World City and the place was already pretty filled when we came back."

"384"|"statement"|"statement"|"He then prepared 3 pieces of scallops topped with their soy caviar (tapioca sago) so we could have 1 each when the standard serving is 2."
"385"|"statement"|"statement"|"I asked why and he couldn't answer."
"386"|"statement"|"statement"|"Which means it's the easy choice for late night suppers when you're not in the mood to get carbo coma from prata."
"387"|"statement"|"statement"|"Now this is the part where you'll slap me in the face- I actually didn't order dim sum this time around because I was feeling under the weather (stomach-wise.)"
"388"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is the first place I go when I get to Singapore."
"389"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was excited when I heard that Tampopo opened up an outlet in Orchard which I frequent more than Clarke Quay."
"390"|"statement"|"statement"|"There is an option to get less noodles but again, make sure they understand you when you order (I'm also pretty convinced its the same portion anyway)."
"391"|"statement"|"statement"|"I love Italian food and was very happy when I found out about this place in our hood."
"392"|"statement"|"statement"|"Maxwell is as old school as it gets when it comes to hawker centers in Singapore, the variety is awesome, and quality top notch."
"393"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even when it's not very crowded."
"394"|"statement"|"statement"|"Although beware of Singapore's unforgiving humidity when deciding between outdoor or indoor seating."
"395"|"statement"|"statement"|"So I was pleasantly surprised when I tried the Tsukiji balls - the batter is extremely tasty and it is always nicely crisp on the outside."
"396"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Kanto way (Tokyo region) or Kansai way (Osaka region) -  both differs in the timing when the sauce is introduced in the dish."
"397"|"statement"|"statement"|"Given this discovery, why not have a Pizza throw-down (an ode to Bobby flay) review: Alt Pizza vs."
"398"|"statement"|"statement"|"You can go to the bar and check out what beers are left on tap."
"399"|"statement"|"statement"|"The bar has a counter where you can 'pour' your own wine."
"400"|"statement"|"statement"|"Because that's the one reason to go - 50% off most things, bringing the price slightly below what is normal for what is served."
"401"|"statement"|"statement"|"No serviettes or tissues on the table, place was fairly empty when I arrived at 12:30pm whereas other restaurants were full, avoid this like organised religion."
"402"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just relax and enjoy, the chef even came over to talk to us about what he prepared."
"403"|"statement"|"statement"|"Still, thanks for the service with a smile even when my partner and I were the last to leave on a late weekday night :)"
"404"|"statement"|"statement"|"ok, so i wouldn't come here expecting a mexican joint, but the food is decent if you take it for what it's worth."
"405"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm generally a happy man when I get fragrant fried rice with succulent prawns."
"406"|"statement"|"statement"|"Whenever I am around Cineleisure and I am feeling peckish, Best Fries Forever will usually be the place where you will find me satisfying my hunger."
"407"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't remember the meats being so burnt when it first opened, maybe they need to clean their grills!"
"408"|"statement"|"statement"|"The XLB is what you get here if you didn't know, you can get other stuff but the XLB is what you should put down in the box as soon as you sit down."
"409"|"statement"|"statement"|"The tea was very fragrant and flavorful but what really stole the show was the crepe cake!!"
"410"|"statement"|"statement"|"I work near Marina Square and was going to pick up lunch at Emporium Shokuhin when I saw some adds for an executive lunch at a rooftop restaurant called the East Bureau with pan Asian cuisine, so I decided to check it out."
"411"|"statement"|"statement"|"Tucked in one corner of Concorde Hotel, this place's customers are obviously those who know it and specially patronize it instead of just randomly passing by."
"412"|"statement"|"statement"|"Only when I told the manager did it come."
"413"|"statement"|"statement"|"There are these times that one has an inkling that a place is good - just judging by what it looks like."
"414"|"statement"|"statement"|"He was sweating bullets but of course a guy had to look strong especially when surrounded by two pretty girls that he shared his table with."
"415"|"question"|"question"|"But what was it Melbourne that was better?"
"416"|"statement"|"statement"|"Besides the salads and wraps, they also have juices and drinks by the side so just grab what you want and pay for it together with your salad."
"417"|"statement"|"statement"|"and that was back in 2007, when i first started yelping in the USofA."
"418"|"statement"|"statement"|"Go when it is not busy."
"419"|"question"|"question"|"Perfectly poached eggs with chunky succulent and sweet smoked ham, creamy hollandaise sauce with the right amount of acidity, what more can i ask for in a Benny?"
"420"|"statement"|"statement"|"Original-destination: UYE#2 @ Immigrants Bar, Joo Chiat Random-pit-stop: Mongkok Dim Sum  Stefan L. and I were making our way to the second UYE at Immigrant's Bar when hunger climbed into the control mechanisms within our brains and piloted us off the bus just two short stops after we got on from the Kallang MRT Station."
"421"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure what the bill came out to as colleague generously paid for us 4."
"422"|"statement"|"statement"|"The pork buns are NOT as good as what the reviews say."
"423"|"statement"|"statement"|"There were some gaps where they were not really checking in."
"424"|"statement"|"statement"|"Good pasta texture and shoyu broth base that when well with the egg."
"425"|"statement"|"statement"|"A real treat is when the Starlight Alchemy movement artists make their weekly appearances."
"426"|"statement"|"statement"|"The service is awesome and the staff is friendly and recommended me the most delicious udon they serve when I looked around the restaurant, not sure what to do.The prices are very affordable and give really nice comfort food for that price."
"427"|"statement"|"statement"|"So I tagged on quietly, albeit excitedly...for what we will be having at this pit-stop."
"428"|"statement"|"statement"|"But when you want the sugar, look no further than the crispy, sweet churros."
"429"|"statement"|"statement"|"This location also has a small store attached where you can buy Italian pasta, flour, chocolate, drinks etc."
"430"|"statement"|"statement"|"I enjoyed every dish, some of which I didn't like having had them before; I won't say what because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone."
"431"|"statement"|"statement"|"If I ever get around to trying the other traditional desserts I'll update this review but when I go there I always end up ordering or nee..and I take it away for my parents too who love or nee."
"432"|"statement"|"statement"|"And in the end, when the waitress's came and cleared the table, she asked if we would like to take away the remaining palm sized piece of meat."
"433"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was a bit less impressed when they noticed that they had charged us $15 for that extra order."
"434"|"statement"|"statement"|"Perhaps unfair to all the good places here but I just find myself annoyed when I go here."
"435"|"statement"|"statement"|"I regretted that immediately when I saw the pricetag, which was over $50/head."
"436"|"statement"|"statement"|"One of the best tapas places Ive been to, where everything actually tastes great."
"437"|"statement"|"statement"|"Time and time again I have been served by black-faced waitresses who toss menus at me and seem to have an attitude if I dare ask a question about the menu."
"438"|"question"|"question"|"Washrooms here are pretty nasty... but what can you do?~  Overall, it was a good experience - more on the fact that the lunch special was a great meal since they provide a lot for that price and you definitely get comfy once you sit in the booths."
"439"|"statement"|"statement"|"Its good food, and was relatively affordable, but I'm not sure why they are SO crowded!"
"440"|"statement"|"statement"|"First of all the color of it look amazing, than the amount of fresh cockles you get in your order was way more than what $4 will get you, I was expecting 3 or 4 pieces but it was a nice big spoonful of them."
"441"|"statement"|"statement"|"I would actually say that while the omakase is enjoyable, it wasn't very filling (again with this filling thing, I'm quite the black hole when it comes to food), but some of the dishes were very creative and overall the meal is rather enjoyable especially since you're paying between $60-$80 dollars for it."
"442"|"statement"|"statement"|"Um... OK.  We weren't the only people there, but there certainly was plenty of room for the few people who were waiting."
"443"|"statement"|"statement"|"So I was sold when they listed what they had and said Sangria."
"444"|"statement"|"statement"|"Granted it was a Saturday afternoon and from what I've heard (they're always packed), I felt that it should have been made clear that there was a waiting list for seating."
"445"|"statement"|"statement"|"The marshmallow ice cream is a little bit too sweet for my liking but it was a good combination with espresso shot - what my friend commented."
"446"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were just checking out the various Japanese restaurants in Cuppage Plaza when one of the staff came out and started recommending the dishes."
"447"|"statement"|"statement"|"30 minutes later (yes, it took forever), what came to our table was this block of tough inedible meat."
"448"|"statement"|"statement"|"No 4 is probably why most people are here."
"449"|"statement"|"statement"|"I thought the name was clever, and I knew exactly what they were going to be serving."
"450"|"statement"|"statement"|"That's where the accolades end."
"451"|"statement"|"statement"|"The fries were actually delivered with no truffle oil at all and then when we reminded her- they delivered a very small amount of oil in a ramikin that was enough for 1 of us, but not 3."
"452"|"statement"|"statement"|"I wouldnt come here on a date but when I am craving some wings and cheap beer I'd stop by for sure."
"453"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just be careful when you bite into it, so that the filling does not dribble down your chin."
"454"|"question"|"question"|"After work, where else to go?"
"455"|"statement"|"statement"|"The chocolate itself wasn't bad but the viscosity of the drink reminded me of when is first tried to make hot chocolate with equal parts milk and chocolate."
"456"|"statement"|"statement"|"There was a sign in the restaurant saying that people who don't drink alcohol aren't welcome -- but again it does not explicitly say everyone present must drink."
"457"|"statement"|"statement"|"Portions are huge and you can help yourself to the salsa bar where there are different types of salsa."
"458"|"statement"|"statement"|"OMG when the noodles arrived I dugged right in."
"459"|"statement"|"statement"|"Our favourite combination is the white veggies with pork chop and egg.. two packets is $6+.. we're not big eaters so that's about what we 3 people can share with.. and then we get some additional ngor hiang from the store directly across."
"460"|"statement"|"statement"|"and for the price of $15 for mine, I doubt I'll be back again when there are so many better options - even Keisuke Four Seasons at Bugis Village."
"461"|"statement"|"statement"|"The light delicate shells crackle as one bites into it and next comes the moment when the mouth is pleasantly violated with the luscious fillings."
"462"|"statement"|"statement"|"Owned by the Sapporo Lion Group, it is first and foremost, a beer hall where diners can chill out in a cosy setting with the refreshing Sapporo beer and moreish bites."
"463"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure what station, playlist or CD it was but when I was there, it was some spin on reggae/Jamaican vibes."
"464"|"statement"|"statement"|"I tried telling 10 taxi drivers Tian Tian Chicken Rice and only the last 1 of the 10 knew what I was talking about."
"465"|"statement"|"statement"|"despite our party being huge (20pax+++)  and constantly moving around/mingling and changing seats, the waiter knew exactly what everyone ordered and served each person his/her correct bill."
"466"|"statement"|"statement"|"I can understand why their customers are willing to stand in line to savor this excellent roasted meat."
"467"|"statement"|"statement"|"For the times when you want something quick, yet healthy."
"468"|"statement"|"statement"|"This market is also attached to a large wet market so you can walk around when you're doing eating."
"469"|"statement"|"statement"|"But still a nice place to just people watch (right at the cross road where Tiong Bahru market is) or just read a book (not as busy as Tiong Bahru bakery right across the road, and definitely not as noisy...)."
"470"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not much to say about service as it's a food court, but tables and area were super clean and not that busy when we went during the off-hour."
"471"|"statement"|"statement"|"When you ordered your soft serve, the person in charged of the cashier will ask for your name so that they can call your name when it is ready."
"472"|"statement"|"statement"|"Too bad waiters aren't quite trained and familiar with american condiments i.e., mustard, balsamic vinegar, etc Other than that, good place for those who wants chilis or aplebees alternatives"
"473"|"statement"|"statement"|"So when put in the wrap, it was a lot of meat, not enough skin."
"474"|"statement"|"statement"|"Definitely tasted different when I last had it a couple years back."
"475"|"rhetoric"|"rhetoric"|"But on overall, there are better places for Japanese food at Clarke Quay so why bother?"
"476"|"question"|"question"|"can i eat pig heart? "
"477"|"statement"|"statement"|"The choices of the hotdogs on offer are really unique and different and not what you normally get."
"478"|"statement"|"statement"|"I love ceviche (& all raw fish dishes by extension: sashimi, poke,...yum), boozy nights, and I have a fondness for offal so when my friend asked me to go to Tiger's milk, I had one look on the menu and enthusiastically said: yes please!"
"479"|"statement"|"statement"|"We love a good burger bar and was gutted when discovering that Mojo Burps, one of if not our favorite burger joint, had closed."
"480"|"statement"|"statement"|"I should probably return with my friends who are regulars to see if I can get more hits than ok-dishes for my omakase."
"481"|"statement"|"statement"|"For those of you who wonder what the heck is Zosui, well, according to an encyclopedia, Z?sui is a Japanese rice soup made from pre-cooked rice and water."
"482"|"statement"|"statement"|"Finally a friend who can read it found there was an option to switch to English (upper right corner)."
"483"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was da bomb, so please give it a try when you make your way to the restaurant."
"484"|"statement"|"statement"|"The man taking our orders was pleasant enough, but the lady who delivered our burgers just plonked them on the table with nary a word or explanation of which was which until we asked her."
"485"|"statement"|"statement"|"was SGD 26, about twice what it should be."
"486"|"statement"|"statement"|"Check-in staff are really nice and I remember once, my phone died and I needed to call someone who was staying in the rooms - and the staff at the lobby were very friendly, and totally did their best to help me."
"487"|"statement"|"statement"|"It is unlike other waffles where everything goes drippy drip and all you have on the other end of the fork is a gooey mash (not that it's a bad thing though)."
"488"|"statement"|"statement"|"For the beverage, I asked one of the staffs whether the ice lemon tea was homemade and when she answered it was, I ordered that."
"489"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even when it's really busy you can still find a place to sit."
"490"|"statement"|"statement"|"I keep thinking that it's a nice place to have a quiet breakfast date with myself and then am surprised when I show up."
"491"|"statement"|"statement"|"Restaurants can be a bit pricey, but not what you wouldn't expect in other restaurants around the area."
"492"|"statement"|"statement"|"Almost as good as what I had back in Australia."
"493"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm not big on drinking a lot when eating sushi however they have a bar there which by itself is worth visiting as well."
"494"|"statement"|"statement"|"Decide what you like and order more of those!"
"495"|"statement"|"statement"|"It looked like it may have been a much nicer place when it first opened then it is currently."
"496"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, I am not a fan of their misleading chef who unfortunately mis-informed me that the salmon sashimi was 'sold out' at 7.30pm."
"497"|"statement"|"statement"|"For anyone who loves to have a variety of dishes for any meal, the small plates format is your best option."
"498"|"statement"|"statement"|"So others who have a preference can go with the leaner or fatter meats if they so prefer."
"499"|"statement"|"statement"|"and what you would pay for a small bag in Jasons you can get more than a basket!"
"500"|"statement"|"statement"|"- I think back to Alinea where I ate a fruit leather balloon or had a decadently filled Chocolate urn shattered onto my waterproof tablecloth."
"501"|"statement"|"statement"|"Located opposite Parliament House and really near the Supreme Courts was this cafe where I dashed in today for my caffeine fix."
"502"|"statement"|"statement"|"I find that when you layer any type of mushroom soup with multiple types of mushrooms you get a full flavor that brings out the best in possible flavor."
"503"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you don't know what to get, Amanda is really good at giving recommendations."
"504"|"question"|"question"|"You don't blame them, do you, but what harm could would it have done if I had sat quietly at a table reading my newspaper while they were opening up?"
"505"|"statement"|"statement"|"A good bowl of pho is what awaits you at this simple Vietnamese restaurant."
"506"|"statement"|"statement"|"The ambiance is fabulous, in a trendy ladies who lunch kind of way."
"507"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have a soft spot for the restaurant - and always remember my first visit when panna cotta was described to me as angmoh tauhuay - which means a western rendition of the asian dessert of sweetened silken soy tofu."
"508"|"statement"|"statement"|"Its the places you will go when you wanna chitchat n have japanese food with some sake."
"509"|"statement"|"statement"|"You don't order from a menu, you explain to the bar staff what you want (spicy, sweet, fruity etc or a type of alcohol, or a cocktail you like)."
"510"|"statement"|"statement"|"The yakitori is good but its not why I come here."
"511"|"statement"|"statement"|"After waiting at our table outside the restaurant for approximately 30 minutes, we decided to check on our orders with the waitress/hostess who took them."
"512"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not really the best seats in the house, but this is where you usually end up if you arrive later in the evening and all the other seating options have been taken up."
"513"|"statement"|"statement"|"Llaollao is located opposite Toast Box, taking over the spot where Subway used to be, right by the sliding doors leading to the taxi stand."
"514"|"question"|"question"|"Seriously, who puts masala powder on top of a sorbet?"
"515"|"statement"|"statement"|"The springy texture is just what i look for in a good carrot cake."
"516"|"question"|"question"|"^whatever Adrianna said  You know what makes it more impressive?"
"517"|"statement"|"statement"|"Please someone tell me who makes the best in sg."
"518"|"statement"|"statement"|"However I'm used to having my soup a little bit more on the saltier side when it comes to prawn Mee."
"519"|"statement"|"statement"|"We went with some friends that live in Singapore and eat here on a somewhat regular basis so service was pretty good compared to what I've read elsewhere."
"520"|"statement"|"statement"|"Forget what I said before!"
"521"|"statement"|"statement"|"May be a little too rich to have it often but when we do crave the rich broth and can get away from the standard pork broth, we will be back!"
"522"|"statement"|"statement"|"Crab ramen is not what I expected."
"523"|"statement"|"statement"|"Don't even know what this is called but I asked for a noodle dish that is popular with locals."
"524"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was not sure about this place (because of its name), but when I tried it I was pleasantly surprised!"
"525"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't know when was the last time I ate that much of anything."
"526"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's the sort of place where you know not a lot of cooking is involved and a lot of the things they use are very commercial (like the ice cream and the drinks) but you don't mind it anyway because sometimes that's all you want, one random afternoon."
"527"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have never understood how or why people eat cereal or fruit for breakfast."
"528"|"question"|"question"|"This is spicy to me, but not in the OMG my mouth is on fire where is the water?"
"529"|"statement"|"statement"|"Singapore is truly a breathtaking country where no one sleeps; bars and lounges close at 4AM."
"530"|"statement"|"statement"|"Thus, after watching the hunger-inducing documentary Jiro dreams of sushi, I felt compelled to try the real deal at what is considered one of the best sushi restaurants in Singapore."
"531"|"statement"|"statement"|"Luckily I was more than happy to finish of the rest when my friend had enough of the rich flavours."
"532"|"statement"|"statement"|"I like my dumplings boiled every time I had gyoza, even when I had them abroad."
"533"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service was trying when there's a crowd but still acceptable."
"534"|"statement"|"statement"|"Due to the layout, it seems like there was a constant echo where we were seated."
"535"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were just walking around the Red Light District when we came across No Signboard, and we were very excited because we had read quite a bit about how great the seafood is!"
"536"|"statement"|"statement"|"Would recommend for those who don't mind paying a little more for quality food."
"537"|"statement"|"statement"|"I used to stay at Toa Payoh"
"538"|"statement"|"statement"|"It comes with a taller glass when you ordered a cold, not giving the extra ml but to hold the ice cubes that made up the larger content now."
"539"|"statement"|"statement"|"You know it's well cured when all you taste is the sweetness of the cured meat (an amateur-cured Jamon will leave u with the slight smell of pork)."
"540"|"statement"|"statement"|"I headed to Ippudo  by chance, was around the area when my friends and I were craving for ramen for dinner."
"541"|"question"|"question"|"Opps what if I say this place is even better than Ippudo?"
"542"|"statement"|"statement"|"Start off by getting a basket of Victor's signature Golden Egg Yolk Lava Bun ($3.50 for 3), and be careful when you split it the middle to let steam out, because the glorious golden filling might just ooze out (and make a mess!)."
"543"|"statement"|"statement"|"The quality is over the top and hence why the restaurant charges as a premium: SGD58 for Chirashi."
"544"|"statement"|"statement"|"Gives the d?cor an extra flair if you know what I mean!"
"545"|"statement"|"statement"|"Compared to the food courts in the US, this place was incredible in terms of variety and quality, so much so that you'll need 15 minutes just to walk around the area to see what you want to eat."
"546"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even more so when there isn't a service charge levied."
"547"|"statement"|"statement"|"Another great stop for late night supper - BK eating house is famed for this store that sells what they term as 'specialty mee sua' which essentially means they do it pretty damn good."
"548"|"statement"|"statement"|"A few apron-clad personnel will bring you the food when it's ready except for the soup when it's readily available."
"549"|"statement"|"statement"|"So when my husband and I sat down at this restaurant to order food and dessert for ourselves, we took out some toddler food for our son so he could also enjoy a snack with us."
"550"|"statement"|"statement"|"And, of course, where the ladies flock so do the men."
"551"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, when a friend visiting from HK expressed a craving for black pepper crabs, I did a quick HGW search on the nearby seafood places upon which Long Beach and Jumbo at Dempsey and the recently opened Red House at Quayside popped up."
"552"|"statement"|"statement"|"Salt Grill is an awesome place for a special occasion dinner, and I also agree with the other reviewers who say it's a good venue for treating out your parental units."
"553"|"statement"|"statement"|"The crabs are usually proudly displayed at the stall window if and when available."
"554"|"statement"|"statement"|"I did not need to add the syrup, except when the cream ran out."
"555"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'd recommend this restaurant to two kinds of people: those who are trying to show off our local cuisine or those who had not have salt in years."
"556"|"statement"|"statement"|"There are countless times when I've been to vegetarian restaurants and walked out feeling like I had three value meals at McDonalds."
"557"|"statement"|"statement"|"I didn't know what else to say."
"558"|"statement"|"statement"|"I felt the salmon didn't have a heavy dressing, and that was what I was after."
"559"|"statement"|"statement"|"I ponder briefly why this dish makes me so happy and I am rewarded with a moment of sentimental clarity."
"560"|"statement"|"statement"|"There is a supervisor at the dessert stand who is overweight and unfriendly."
"561"|"statement"|"statement"|"The rice in the claypot was smoky yet fluffy, and when drenched in sweet sauce was just... wow."
"562"|"statement"|"statement"|"This joint is literally located under my house, so I decided to pop in and see what they had."
"563"|"statement"|"statement"|"It only gets worse when she tells you that the only way to get both Chilli crab & the Pepper crab is to order the Alaskan King crab at $200 /kg with a minimum size of 2kg."
"564"|"statement"|"statement"|"5) Claypot fishhead - We always used to see lots of people ordering this and finally when I brought my family and had enough people I got to try it."
"565"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"how the heck you come up with this review!? "
"566"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is what culinary creativity is in its finest."
"567"|"statement"|"statement"|"There's a jollibee that has a better red bean slushy drink if that's what you're into in the basement food court of the next mall over."
"568"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't get why people say this place is 'posh'."
"569"|"statement"|"statement"|"The meat was just so tender and juicy (still cannot compare to American beef in flavor) that it was with sadness when I popped in the last bite."
"570"|"statement"|"statement"|"The chef forgot about me towards the end of my omakase when other patrons started being seated and I constantly had to flag down a waitress to fill my tea and to also pour my expensive Shinji-branded sake into our carafe (since there is nowhere on the counter that they could put it, they had it next to them)."
"571"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Les Amis group should probably stick to what it's good at."
"572"|"statement"|"statement"|"Must try when you are in Singapore and is by the way rated as the best buffet in Singapore by the locals."
"573"|"statement"|"statement"|"This will be one of my regular spots when in singapore!"
"574"|"statement"|"statement"|"It has the perfect brioche bread, topped with the perfect bechamel sauce and melty Gruyere cheese and ham....it is EXACTLY what a croque Monsieur should be."
"575"|"question"|"question"|"Even when the last dishes come out- (like today, 15 mins after the first ones)- somehow half the stuff on the plate is barely warm..  How does this happen?"
"576"|"statement"|"statement"|"Plus for the most part, I didn't want a dining experience and preferred to pick what I wanted and to sit down."
"577"|"statement"|"statement"|"There's a reason why there's more than one type."
"578"|"statement"|"statement"|"I always come here to grab a meal (at least once) when I come to Singapore."
"579"|"statement"|"statement"|"While the coffee is nicely balanced, it isn't THE best I've had so far, but, it's a good cuppa for those who don't want an overly strong or potent coffee."
"580"|"statement"|"statement"|"this was so good that when I first bit into it, I practically trailed off whatever conversation I was having, and all the excellent dishes we had before hand just seemed to pale in comparison."
"581"|"statement"|"statement"|"I went about 630pm and it took about 20 minutes before we could get in to be seated, but at least the staff passed us the menu to place orders first so that we could pass the waitresses the order chits when we got in."
"582"|"statement"|"statement"|"By this time, you're thinking, why come to sky on 57 to have street food you could get for $5 down the street."
"583"|"statement"|"statement"|"I couldn't figure out why this place was packed."
"584"|"statement"|"statement"|"food is a necessity, i need it "
"585"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have climbed highest mountain I have run through the fields Only to be with you Only to be with you  I have run I have crawled I have scaled these city walls These city walls Only to be with you  But I think I have found what I'm looking for But I think I have found what I'm looking for  say goodbye to no good vietnamese food!"
"586"|"statement"|"statement"|"it's not fanciful food, and also not the best cze char I've had - por kee just a couple minutes away might do a better job, but these two places remind me of exactly what it is our parents are missing when they see the country changing - and sometimes you realise just what it is we may be losing what with all our new hipster coffee joints and hyped food imports."
"587"|"statement"|"statement"|"I guess there are a certain amount of harried desk-bound folks who appreciate not having to queue for a long time and are small eaters will be fine with Munch."
"588"|"statement"|"statement"|"I actually lack the vocab to tell you why I love it."
"589"|"statement"|"statement"|"Mexican food in Singapore is a bit hit or miss, so we were not sure what to expect."
"590"|"statement"|"statement"|"Recently moved to Singapore and I am always on a lookup for a new places and new go to restaurants and this will be one on my list for some time when here."
"591"|"statement"|"statement"|"In general, I think this is a decent place to take friends from out of town who want to try Peranakan food but who wouldn't enjoy the environs of a hawker centre."
"592"|"statement"|"statement"|"And apparently in the same fashion as their hotpot ritual, when your soup comes out, all of the toppings are on the side and you are encouraged to taste the soup through each stage of its evolution, sampling different flavours as you drop in greens, cabbage, egg, chicken, seaweed, and yuzu rind."
"593"|"statement"|"statement"|"Waaay better than what I've had at Tonkichi."
"594"|"statement"|"statement"|"Look it over and decide what you want to eat."
"595"|"question"|"question"|"The tacos tasted microwaved, the pork was dry, where is the beef infusion that you guys were raving about?!"
"596"|"statement"|"statement"|"As the Pizzas are made to order only, waiting times can be a little long when they're packed, so expect some downtime after ordering."
"597"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm a huge adept of skybars, so when my friend told me Altitude is the highest one in the world, I was soooooo excited to go there."
"598"|"statement"|"statement"|"We visited a few Din Tai Fung restaurants when we were in Singapore and were blown away at their good quality control."
"599"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was in for a bit of shock when I first saw it, but I realized that if you have the fillings separated from the crepe the crepe would taste much better and it would not become soggy."
"600"|"statement"|"statement"|"And for Ang Mohs who are just entering the world of Asian food this is a great place to start ;)"
"601"|"statement"|"statement"|"I did not expect that when I took a queue number at the stall."
"602"|"statement"|"statement"|"It makes me really sad when fish die and their death is wasted on sub-par meal."
"603"|"statement"|"statement"|"Here are a couple of the dishes I have tried which are mention worthy and some you should definitely try when visiting Spize."
"604"|"statement"|"statement"|"But they came with a cinnamon style jam which when used together gave the sensation of eating a cheese donut.... Weird."
"605"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you're a person who enjoys France, this is a place you'll simply love!"
"606"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's the most connected MRT interchange for now, with North-South line, North-East line and Circle line connected to it, so when people can't decide where to meet up, I pick here because it's the easiest for me and most others!"
"607"|"statement"|"statement"|"Must try when in Singapore."
"608"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was craving ramen so badly when I went to Singapore on my 5 days trip so I was browsing and looking for interesting ramen place."
"609"|"statement"|"statement"|"They even carry some pansy craft-crap for those who can't hold anything down."
"610"|"statement"|"statement"|"Ground floor is currently about the late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who was instrumental in making Singapore what it is today."
"611"|"statement"|"statement"|"The service was attentive and my water was always being re-filled (I love when I don't have to flag down someone to re-fill water!"
"612"|"question"|"question"|"The ugly: Where do you go from here when you've tasted the best?"
"613"|"statement"|"statement"|"We did do a half bottle of a nice Spanish Tempranillo, however, where instead of opening a half bottle of wine, they use their Coravin device - something I feel is more appropriate for doing high end wine by the glass rather than saying you are selling a half bottle."
"614"|"statement"|"statement"|"Personally speaking, this place has a great balance of both and if you don't believe me just ask the Vietnamese girls who frequent there."
"615"|"statement"|"statement"|"My pinky dinger refused to bend, no matter what I did."
"616"|"statement"|"statement"|"Hopefully the selection of beers will still be interesting and extensive when they re-open!"
"617"|"statement"|"statement"|"The meat was tender and flavorful, but what really made me fall in love with the dish was the mashed potatoes and the mushrooms."
"618"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you are the type who can't stand cilantro / coriander and the likes, i can already guarantee you would hate this dish."
"619"|"statement"|"statement"|"Must try when in Singapore."
"620"|"statement"|"statement"|"As a girl who loves breakfast options, and was in search of something reminiscent of an American brunch experience, I'd pass."
"621"|"statement"|"statement"|"They didn't lie when they said it was the world's highest brewery at 33 levels above ground."
"622"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's funny, I have never thought of myself as someone who cares about service or ambience at all, I care mostly about the food, but there is just something about the delivery of this place that doesn't sit well with me."
"623"|"question"|"question"|"Not only could you taste that it needed to be changed desperately but it made you wonder what kind of an establishment can be so good in other things but overlook rookie mistakes?"
"624"|"statement"|"statement"|"I am sure it is super healthy and I love that they tell you the calories in each cup, but I feel it is a it gimmicky and too much expensive for what you get."
"625"|"statement"|"statement"|"Once you get to the display cases, you will need to tell them what you want."
"626"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've eaten at some really good traditional and modern sushi places in SoCal, New York and Florida so that's the bar I'm setting and probably why this may be a little cruel for a restaurant trying to meet a void in the Japanese restaurant scene here."
"627"|"statement"|"statement"|"The goreng pisang (fried banana fritter) is really good when fresh out of the fryer."
"628"|"statement"|"statement"|"The fact that these are 4 for $20 SGD is painful, but hey, its also pretty remarkable & amazing when you think about it."
"629"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's about a 200m uncovered walk from the bridge to the cafe so it's a bit of a hassle especially when it rains."
"630"|"statement"|"statement"|"Was slightly apprehensive because the restaurant was completely empty when we arrived for dinner at 8 on a Thursday night."
"631"|"statement"|"statement"|"Everything else was okay, I'd come back again if I was in the area and didn't know what to eat."
"632"|"statement"|"statement"|"They say you get what you pay for and thus I was more than pleasantly surprised at the spread for lunch at Chiso Zanmai considering it's just $15 for an all-you-can-eat buffet."
"633"|"statement"|"statement"|"We liked the En restaurant at Bukit Timah so we decided to try their sister restaurant when we saw their offer on Groupon."
"634"|"statement"|"statement"|"This was my first stop for food when I arrived at Singapore."
"635"|"question"|"question"|"can you be more relevant? "
"636"|"statement"|"statement"|"In fact, this was what happened to the Spinach Artichoke Dip ($13.90) which made it so difficult to resist from scooping the baked cheesy goodness with  taco chips."
"637"|"statement"|"statement"|"I ask the waiter what type of fish is used."
"638"|"statement"|"statement"|"That's slang for this place is the bees knees/ the hippest place on the block/ where the party is at 24/7!"
"639"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is what my gf remembered as her favorite thing about this place."
"640"|"statement"|"statement"|"Didn't take long for the food to arrive and timing was good as what you'd see in hells kitchen or any other Gordon Ramsay shows... Mac and cheese.. Was FANTASTIC!!"
"641"|"statement"|"statement"|"It is what it is - an after hours restaurant, serving the needs of night owls."
"642"|"statement"|"statement"|"When I turned 18 in the States, I knew when I came back to visit Singapore, I wanted to order a Singapore Sling from Long Bar in the middle of the afternoon."
"643"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've got to admit I'm a bit picky when it comes to korean bbq."
"644"|"statement"|"statement"|"They may be better elsewhere but I like to have a bite or two when trying new things."
"645"|"statement"|"statement"|"And I mean the type I got used to when I was living in Melbourne."
"646"|"statement"|"statement"|"Large apple tea ($4.50) - 3.5 stars  Ambience - 5 stars Came here to play a board game with friends in the afternoon when it wasn't too crowded."
"647"|"statement"|"statement"|"Smelled lovely when it first arrived, we couldn't taste the truffle."
"648"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's not the fanciest of places, nor the cheapest of places, but it's a simple no-frills option that I often turn to when I'm stumped on where to eat."
"649"|"statement"|"statement"|"You sit in air-conditioned comfort, take a few minutes to decide what you want from the small menu, and the food comes in about 5 minutes."
"650"|"statement"|"statement"|"Quite simply, Jaan is one of the best fine dining restaurants in Singapore and another one of what I would expect to get the top Michelin Star marks."
"651"|"statement"|"statement"|"Decent coffee is served here, bit when it gets really hot, I order a fresh juice or a San pelligrino to cool off."
"652"|"statement"|"statement"|"They serve all day breakfast here from 8am to 5pm, and even give early birds a local black coffee or tea offer at $1 when you order local breakfast items between 8am-10am."
"653"|"statement"|"statement"|"BUT, what was served up at the other tables that ordered ala carte from their menu looked really good so perhaps they do have more saving grace than what I've experienced."
"654"|"statement"|"statement"|"Very satisfying Penang Char Kway Teow that I always have when I come here, leaving me no space in my tummy to try anything else."
"655"|"statement"|"statement"|"Coz when it's good."
"656"|"statement"|"statement"|"The servers at Sumiya were also very quick and attentive, delivering the food the minute each kitchen station put them out, which is critical when you want hot food to go with your beer."
"657"|"statement"|"statement"|"And you do get what you pay for."
"658"|"statement"|"statement"|"There are other condiments, a fried egg, cucumber slices and ikan bills, the ubiquitous accompaniment to any self-respecting nasi lemak, but your brain is past caring about these other players on the plate and your eyes struggle to focus on what it is exactly that you've put in your mouth that still has you reeling."
"659"|"statement"|"statement"|"The line was already snaking out the door again when we left right around noon."
"660"|"statement"|"statement"|"I wondered if it is because of the popular Shanghai Hairy crab that explains why Nanxiang uses crab roe in many dishes such as The Stir fried Crab Roe Green Bean Noodle ($12.80) and the Crab Roe Mee Sua ($12.80)."
"661"|"statement"|"statement"|"As she did not know what to order we chatted a bit with the staff and they offered small tasters of all the teas (3 of them)."
"662"|"statement"|"statement"|"Everything is presented well, you can choose what you want and then give your card to the person serving at that station to add to your bill."
"663"|"statement"|"statement"|"But unfortunately, it's not like mcdonalds, no matter where you go a Big Mac tastes like a Big Mac."
"664"|"statement"|"statement"|"All in all a super place to go when you're hungry and a must try in Singapore!"
"665"|"statement"|"statement"|"Upon arrival we stood what felt like ages in front of the reception desk with it being obvious that none other then the elderly gentleman behind the desk - we assume the owner - being entitled to welcome us and provide us with a table."
"666"|"statement"|"statement"|"I already love Affogatos (vanilla ice cream with a shot of espresso) but doing it with Coconut ice cream is like that windows shattering in your head when you find your favorite dessert can actually be better."
"667"|"statement"|"statement"|"SATAY BEEF Hubby was really concerned about the size of the beef when he saw the '80g' next to the menu but he was surprised that the beef was quite big."
"668"|"statement"|"statement"|"But the steamed chicken and cup of broth is such a comforting meal after a long day or when you get home sick :-)"
"669"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had major food envy when sampling my fellow diners plates."
"670"|"statement"|"statement"|"A definite choice when thinking about where to head for dinner with a large group of friends!"
"671"|"statement"|"statement"|"The only gripe I had was the end, where I had hope to slurp up my broth like a soup."
"672"|"statement"|"statement"|"It is almost inaccessible without a car but I am blessed with friends who don't mind ferrying me around."
"673"|"statement"|"statement"|"You are a fool"
"674"|"statement"|"statement"|"The only white pizza on the menu now had a cream base so it was not what I had in mind."
"675"|"statement"|"statement"|"I kind of walked around the empty spaces wondering where the museum part was until I found the main entrance, but once I was inside, I found the NMS the most well-curated museum I've ever been to...  You enter the main exhibit and galleries via a cylindrical building and go through a movie...which was the most unnecessary part of this whole experience, since it was just a gathering point."
"676"|"statement"|"statement"|"When entering an indoor space of the cafe (tiny cramped area where they keep all the cakes), we were attended by a man, who looks like a boss of the place."
"677"|"statement"|"statement"|"Bet ur bottom $  When I return to Singapore I won't be rushing back."
"678"|"question"|"question"|"I had a similar experience with Cold Stone Creamery where in Singapore it literally was mind blowingly good but as soon as I went to Taiwan it just didn't taste the same way?"
"679"|"statement"|"statement"|"Unlike many restaurants where they have one particular specialty, the preparation and flavors of the food here are many and varied."
"680"|"statement"|"statement"|"But the first warning sign came when I noticed that any signs of the good ole usual layers of fats seem to be missing."
"681"|"statement"|"statement"|"Here are FIVE REASONS why this is a great location to wine, dine and be merry!"
"682"|"statement"|"statement"|"Garlic Parm Boneless Wings The flavour isn't what I'm expecting."
"683"|"statement"|"statement"|"It didn't start well when they didn't have our reservation."
"684"|"statement"|"statement"|"For a side, I had the Vietnamese Yam Roll and OHMYGOSH WHAT IS THIS PURPLE DELICIOUSNESS."
"685"|"statement"|"statement"|"I like vegetarian food"
"686"|"statement"|"statement"|"The downside is I was just completely flabbergasted at why any service team would do that and I'm pretty sure my comments didn't make it to the management team."
"687"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm a huge fan of those places where their integrity in food shows through from the bread they serve on the side -- they were so well-baked to be crips on the surface and textured just right on the inside."
"688"|"statement"|"statement"|"Downstairs, there's lots of seating and outside they have small tables where you can congregate with your drinks for happy hour."
"689"|"statement"|"statement"|"So an advice for servicemen is to check the products thoroughly and consult if they can be used in camp (especially when it comes to parade items such as their smartest 4)."
"690"|"statement"|"statement"|"it's still not at a point where it's too offensive to eat, and this place still certainly retains good value (especially in town) - just that you'll probably want more than just a bowl of noodles when you're here."
"691"|"statement"|"statement"|"And the owner said forget it during fasting month cos the queue starts at 5.30am which is when he starts cooking the briyani!"
"692"|"rhetoric"|"rhetoric"|"So why not take part in the awakening?"
"693"|"question"|"rhetoric"|"With all due respect, why on Earth would anyone compare Suju to Sukiyabashi Jiro?"
"694"|"statement"|"statement"|"The best Thai food I have ever eaten outside of Thailand (and I consider myself quiet picky when it comes to food)."
"695"|"statement"|"statement"|"When I asked my server what I could have that was gluten free, he pointed to one dish and said 'that one' off the whole menu."
"696"|"statement"|"statement"|"Some waitress are very attentive and polite while others seems to be blind when I was raising my hand to get their attention to Ask for water while my partner was coughing."
"697"|"statement"|"statement"|"For example, when I tried to order a California burrito, I was told that it couldn't be made vegetarian."
"698"|"statement"|"statement"|"Note:  Sometimes I feel unburdened in writing reviews when I do not know a specific cuisine extremely well."
"699"|"statement"|"statement"|"I didn't know what to get so I conducted a small experiment."
"700"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was sad though, when I heard that they didn't serve shoestring potatoes."
"701"|"statement"|"statement"|"In any case, their happy hour (after 9pm) promotion stays where drinks and cakes are at half price!"
"702"|"statement"|"statement"|"It didn't break easily when I picked it up, and it's chewy and there is no weird (preservative) after taste like you'd taste in a cheap dim sum stalls."
"703"|"statement"|"statement"|"And I like the seasoned guy who continues to make the fried rice one batch at a time."
"704"|"statement"|"statement"|"Haven't posted a review in a very long time but when you find a gem, something moves you to leave a remark."
"705"|"statement"|"statement"|"I know I should have written one right from the start when Yelp became an SG phenomenon."
"706"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have also been to places when they can spilt the bill even when it was just 2 persons dining."
"707"|"rhetoric"|"rhetoric"|"Not difficult to understand why I like the place, eh?"
"708"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is a really good starter hawker center for people who are new to Singapore/the hawker center life."
"709"|"statement"|"statement"|"This stall has been around for a long time, I remember visting this stall at the old tiong bahru market when I was a child."
"710"|"statement"|"statement"|"They have specialties occasionally, such as when they serve the blue cheese variety."
"711"|"statement"|"statement"|"I asked the waitress what the catch of the day was."
"712"|"statement"|"statement"|"Only when I have the money though!"
"713"|"statement"|"statement"|"We let the chef decide what to serve and had a beautiful red spread with just the right servings for 5."
"714"|"statement"|"statement"|"What you see is what you get: chicken and rice ;) This dish is so tender and flavored!"
"715"|"statement"|"statement"|"The same wait staff was also very adamant about us hurrying up (close to 30 minutes of our arrival and we were settling in and looking at the menu, taking pictures and just trying to decide on what to order) in placing our order and telling us we need to vacate in an hour time."
"716"|"statement"|"statement"|"Food is very average as its made by volunteers who have a different day job."
"717"|"statement"|"statement"|"But what captivated us the most were the cupcakes on display."
"718"|"statement"|"statement"|"It reminded me of a time when I was a teenager coming to such places with my friends, a treat of a relatively affordable buffet, and we didn't mind the quality of the food as long as it was decent."
"719"|"statement"|"statement"|"We got a larger table in the centre of the restaurant after a small discussion with one of the waiters as he wanted to place us behind the entrance door and argued that he might need the bigger tables later on when they get busy."
"720"|"statement"|"statement"|"for what it's worth, it sounds far more diabetic than it was - it's laudable how they actually managed to keep this mixture from being too cloying."
"721"|"statement"|"statement"|"One would not miss the tuk tuk vehicle which front the dine in area when passing by the shop."
"722"|"statement"|"statement"|"Pretty reasonable.Yong Tau Foo Dry7 items is what I normally get, although you can top up 50 cents for laksa gravy."
"723"|"statement"|"statement"|"Definitely recommend to anyone who is around the area to try it out."
"724"|"statement"|"statement"|"No idea why this place can even be ranked above a 2."
"725"|"statement"|"statement"|"Observation #2: There were no chefs cooking in the brick oven kitchen who looked of Middle Eastern origin either."
"726"|"statement"|"statement"|"There are daily specials on rotation so you never know what is available - Hainanese pork chop, curry pork chop chap chye rice, sweet and sour fish, sweet and sour pork, fish and chips, yong tau foo (ampang style)."
"727"|"statement"|"statement"|"What my family can't or won't do as well, which is also why this place is so awesome, is to make great 'pak cham gai' (steamed chicken) and pork satay and pork chops as well."
"728"|"statement"|"statement"|"I didn't know what happened in the middle, but I have recently started coming here again."
"729"|"statement"|"statement"|"When I am craving crepes this will be where I will look to first."
"730"|"statement"|"statement"|"There are long queues snaking outside the restaurant each time we walk or drive past during dining hours and when we finally got round to trying the food, we were not at all surprised!"
"731"|"statement"|"statement"|"I decided to pay them a visit due to a special they were having where certain bowls of ramen were 50% off on Wednesdays."
"732"|"question"|"question"|"And when you combine those two cuisine?"
"733"|"statement"|"statement"|"Prices are same to what you pay in a neighbourhood dim sum place so a good deal in a nostalgic setting."
"734"|"statement"|"statement"|"The price makes it hard to give five stars, but if you're the sort that's price insensitive when it comes to food (cough cough join the club) then this place will easily win your heart."
"735"|"statement"|"statement"|"Real stay top with Leganes win"
"736"|"statement"|"statement"|"No where else in Singapore will you get the level of personal attention and care that you receive from staff at ShuKuu."
"737"|"statement"|"statement"|"Location location location and man what a location."
"738"|"statement"|"statement"|"I first popped by when they were less than a month old and bought myself a salted caramel ice latte."
"739"|"statement"|"statement"|"Look beyond the bull-@$!# that's been piled on these guys by the media and see it for the single specialty master hawker stall that it is and you'll see what all the fuss is about."
"740"|"statement"|"statement"|"But when it was served, I knew it was exactly like the shaven foie gras p?t? dish that I had in David Chang's momofuku ko restaurant where he served it up like a bowl of savory ice-cream."
"741"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, the tempura and sushi were just ok, not what you expect for this price."
"742"|"statement"|"statement"|"Brunch/Breakfast - I don't know why some initial blogs and reviews had it as just OK but the scrambled eggs are done superbly, the Moroccan variety is hearty and deserve praise and the makeup of the peasant eggs dish is well done."
"743"|"statement"|"statement"|"From what I remember, we had toro, chutoro, amberjack, sardine, mackerel, mirugai, some other fish part that I couldn't understand, ikura, two types of uni, ebi, torched toro, and a toro with union roll."
"744"|"statement"|"statement"|"And this location doesn't have a website but included what appears as the parent company."
"745"|"statement"|"statement"|"Good strategy to carry out: reserve a table, grab a couple of bottles, go make your orders, collect the buzzers, return to table to continue on beer and wait for the buzzers to light up when your food is ready."
"746"|"statement"|"statement"|"Thanks to my beautiful friend who arrived first, I didn't have to queue to get a table for a Saturday brunch."
"747"|"question"|"rhetoric"|"As hungry as a bear I ordered the $22 plus Chicken leg, why so expensive?"
"748"|"question"|"question"|"So for those reviews that say it's not authentic pho, what do they know?"
"749"|"statement"|"statement"|"I can't stand when curries burn a hole in your mouth."
"750"|"statement"|"statement"|"It may be good enough for locals, but as an Asian who was born and raised abroad, I personally don't like it, but give it one try, as I did, and decide for yourself."
"751"|"statement"|"statement"|"Be sure to order this when you're here, and top it off with a light tea, such as a Darjeeling."
"752"|"statement"|"statement"|"Now now, the reason why we went to Mouth Restaurant."
"753"|"statement"|"statement"|"The staff were friendly and knowing it was my first visit, they asked for feedback and explained what the various sauces were for."
"754"|"statement"|"statement"|"We stay here only when the Hyatt is sold out."
"755"|"statement"|"statement"|"So this is a safe on to get for any friend who likes chocolate."
"756"|"question"|"statement"|"I have been to that place before please recommend another one"
"757"|"statement"|"statement"|"Passed by Grand Copthorne hotel quite frequently and wondered what was the inside."
"758"|"statement"|"statement"|"Foie gras became one of my favourite dishes when I visited Budapest."
"759"|"question"|"question"|"I had emailed a co-worker based in Singapore, what were some of the recommendations to eat while in the city?"
"760"|"statement"|"statement"|"They had a live band playing when I was here, though it was more a couple of people on accoustic guitars singing some old eighties songs."
"761"|"statement"|"statement"|"Kid's Set Meal - I must commend their efforts to have a engaging children's menu where the little ones can exercise some choice over their set meal."
"762"|"statement"|"statement"|"The scone set is what I get as it's reasonably priced at about $10.50 for scones and a cup of tea."
"763"|"statement"|"statement"|"I gave the sushis and bentos a go when I returned for my subsequent visits and realized that for the price you're paying, which isn't a lot, you get to enjoy decently authentic Japanese food, and that's why I will keep going back for more."
"764"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is what real street food eating really is: no decor but just eating it out with no care, all reckless abandon; you're not worrying over your clothes or ppl staring lol."
"765"|"statement"|"statement"|"Do take note of your table when placing order."
"766"|"statement"|"statement"|"Rotisserie was my absolute favorite lunch spot back when i was working at raffles place."
"767"|"statement"|"statement"|"A chef did ask me what I do not eat, and i asked for kohada."
"768"|"statement"|"statement"|"Which is always good when you're slurping hot soup."
"769"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you cannot decide what to have, the set dinner option is a good deal at $69 and it generally have pretty good dishes."
"770"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was beautifully presented which I suppose what you pay as part of the price."
"771"|"statement"|"statement"|"Beautifully done when requested for a medium steak."
"772"|"statement"|"statement"|"Quite a number of Singaporeans I know who have been there are not exactly raving about it as some find the spices too strong, certain flavours too mild etc."
"773"|"statement"|"statement"|"But kudos to the service staff here, with special mention of Karlson, who made my family happy with his personalised service, asking if one of my no-show attendees was alright when I told him my table was down a pax due to illness from the haze, addressing me by name, noticing the littlest details of my table - knowing who's birthday we are celebrating even before I had a chance to tell him and just being overall attentive."
"774"|"statement"|"statement"|"I like the creativity that goes into establishments like House, turning what was essentially a former office in a barrack (my uncle used to work here) into a restaurant."
"775"|"statement"|"statement"|"Some of my American friends who came recently thought it had the best burger they've had in this part of the world."
"776"|"statement"|"statement"|"Go straight to the superstar when you order - Pork Gyoza either panfried or boil, depending what you fancy."
"777"|"statement"|"statement"|"Never thought of that when having porridge at home."
"778"|"statement"|"statement"|"Honestly, it wasn't a great first experience as when we approached the restaurant front of staff and asked about vegetarian options for my mother, the lady said there was nothing vegetarian available."
"779"|"statement"|"statement"|"Okay so let start out with the location, this club is located at marina bay sands tower 3, there be a reception right at the lobby where you get checked in and you will receive a card if your on guestlist to be given to another reception counter at 57 floor."
"780"|"statement"|"statement"|"There were minor slip ups here and there, like offering dessert when we still had a main yet to arrive, putting a wine glass on our table when we hadn't ordered anything yet... but then even though we order the potatoes seconds before our main arrived at the table, it still arrived in time to accompany most of it because the kitchen clearly rushed it for us."
"781"|"statement"|"statement"|"That was some serious cheese storage for South East Asia where their idea of cheese is milk processed into cube wrapped in blue Kraft box and called it Processed Cheddar."
"782"|"statement"|"statement"|"But I could easily see how someone who had not researched the place might be."
"783"|"statement"|"statement"|"FYI, this is the only place in Singapore where littering is permitted."
"784"|"statement"|"statement"|"of the restaurant who takes my orders is this friendly Chinese woman who is always happy to have a chat and a laugh."
"785"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even the fish ball soup stall holder who doesn't speak proper english says hello and smiles at me!!"
"786"|"statement"|"statement"|"Fish & Chips  Now THIS is what I call fish and chips."
"787"|"statement"|"statement"|"Our server told us about the oyster farm in DC where they order their oysters from."
"788"|"statement"|"statement"|"The daughter-in-law now runs the stall with her two younger sisters, which is why this place is also known fondly as 3 sisters' claypot rice."
"789"|"statement"|"statement"|"Because everything you need to be all filled up is on that buffet... and who needs an actual main."
"790"|"statement"|"statement"|"Plating looks completely different from what the blogger had."
"791"|"statement"|"statement"|"In fact I just had it sold out again this past Saturday night when I asked for it halfway through my meal."
"792"|"statement"|"statement"|"I expect bars like this to be pricey, especially in Singapore where everything is pricey!"
"793"|"statement"|"statement"|"They will provide you with one of those vibrating and flashing disks to communicate when  your order is completed."
"794"|"statement"|"statement"|"Ah Tai turned out to be the cook who worked for Tin Tin and opened his own place."
"795"|"statement"|"statement"|"It might look better once the works are finished; part of the issue is that one side of the sitting area where food is served is a construction wall."
"796"|"question"|"question"|"Came here on a Sunday morning for the brunch buffet - who says no to free flow dimsum?"
"797"|"statement"|"statement"|"I still don't quite know, but what I do know is that they use a fresh crab claw meat - none of that crab stick rubbish that I absolutely loathe."
"798"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were pretty surprised with the serving size of the linguini though, as it looked like a $5 pasta when served."
"799"|"statement"|"statement"|"I really enjoyed the lunch, but the sticker price (S$65 with bottled water) was quite high for a lunch where you split an entree."
"800"|"statement"|"statement"|"I tried the matzo ball soup as well, and that was ok, but not what I was hoping for - the huge single matzo ball that takes up almost the entire bowl, like you'd get at Carnegie Deli."
"801"|"statement"|"statement"|"The bone marrow came on perfectly toasted sourdough bread, mixed in with anchovies and celeriac, all chopped up so you can't tell what you're eating but it all goes delightfully together."
"802"|"statement"|"statement"|"I wish that I had been informed when I placed my order."
"803"|"statement"|"statement"|"So not entirely cheap for what was offered."
"804"|"statement"|"statement"|"the pricing is what you would expect from a place in Boat quay but I don't find it unreasonable (unless you buy 2 bottles of wine like I did :)..."
"805"|"question"|"question"|"What are the mexican serving restaurants?"
"806"|"statement"|"statement"|"There's a reason why you can't grab seats when you walk in."
"807"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was well lit when we were there, and well-populated with locals so it can't be all bad!!"
"808"|"statement"|"statement"|"Spize is semi-modern with an open front to the shop, air conditioning and for those who love prata it's very own prata station."
"809"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm one of those guys who is useless in the kitchen, but even I could have done that!"
"810"|"statement"|"statement"|"The cook had just finished the last batch when I arrived, so I got to watch him work, and he is a master at it."
"811"|"question"|"question"|"when is the best time to go for lunch in CBD? "
"812"|"statement"|"statement"|"It is the closest to what I am use to from back home - clearer soup, peppery and stronger herb taste."
"813"|"statement"|"statement"|"It ended up being a $3-$5 more for each pizza than if we had gotten specialty pizzas, but we got exactly what we wanted."
"814"|"statement"|"statement"|"While deciding on what to eat for lunch with my friend, I decided to venture the new wing of Plaza Singapura and my friend suggested this place as she is craving more Americanized food (actually Italian food)."
"815"|"statement"|"statement"|"Definitely a cool spot to hit when in singapore and looking for some authentic ethnic south indian food."
"816"|"statement"|"statement"|"The private rooms are on the 2nd level and I am not sure if there are any elevators for those who have difficulties in climbing stairs."
"817"|"statement"|"statement"|"For details, please visit umakemehungry.blogspot sg  I get to know of YY Kopitiam's existence when my Hong Kong pal told me that this was under her list of Must Go places in Singapore."
"818"|"statement"|"statement"|"The food was delicious as expected and I'm sure there are ramen experts out there who are better equipped to provide a concise review on the food."
"819"|"statement"|"statement"|"A good place to go to for supper with decent prices and fairly okay waiting times, the portions of the dim sum might be a tad small for those who are used to bigger portions, so it might be wiser to order two of each to save on waiting times."
"820"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was a bit awkward as the chef is a bit of a character and only wants to cook what he wants to (we had specific request that were denied) but turns out that's a good thing in the end because he is a magician in the kitchen."
"821"|"statement"|"statement"|"This place is kinda like an up version of Subway, where one line is formed in front of the counter where you choose your bread, then type of meat / filling to go with your sandwich, salad toppings, and dressing."
"822"|"statement"|"statement"|"The corn muffins are sweet but also soft and crispy when they're hot, so they're my next favourite food from Kenny Rogers next to the cheese mac."
"823"|"statement"|"statement"|"After I purchased a few of their infused tea and macarons, the female cashier looks very annoyed when I tried to take a picture of the store  No pictures."
"824"|"statement"|"statement"|"There were several people who were taking up the other tables without food waiting for this place to open up again - a sure sign it is worthwhile!"
"825"|"statement"|"statement"|"Sometimes places charge a lot for salmon and what not and then give you a meager portion... NOT HERE!!"
"826"|"statement"|"statement"|"The burger was much smaller than I expected and under $5, but I'd almost claim it as 'overpriced' for what the serving really was."
"827"|"statement"|"statement"|"We got here when it opened (to avoid the long wait since they don't take reservations...I think for weekends especially)."
"828"|"statement"|"statement"|"They manage to keep it simple when it comes to the menu."
"829"|"statement"|"statement"|"Much of the sashimi is seasonal, so always ask for what is available."
"830"|"statement"|"statement"|"I guess that's why the food is so good."
"831"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you're looking for a good plate of wanton noodle, I'd advise you to keep walking, head across the road to Queen St to the block of flats where QS269 is located and find Rong Kee."
"832"|"statement"|"statement"|"You order and pay at the counter and then pick a table inside the store where you can eye all the products on sale or you can sit outside in the courtyard."
"833"|"statement"|"statement"|"Since I tried Tian Tian last time when I was in town, which I enjoyed, this time I decided to give Ah Tai Chicken Rice a try."
"834"|"statement"|"statement"|"One thing to bear in mind however - the point above is simply not relevant for anyone who prefers drip or brewed coffee, and might not even be an issue for anyone else."
"835"|"statement"|"statement"|"and true to the name, it is in fact super and full of treasures when it comes to peking duck."
"836"|"statement"|"statement"|"You get seated when you arrive with menus, then you're given a table number and are told to order at the counter with it when you're ready."
"837"|"question"|"question"|"THe crusty baguette they serve is simply perfect... again, where can I buy this in Singapore?!"
"838"|"statement"|"statement"|"For those who hate mornings but enjoy breakfast, Paul's Bakery has all day breakfasts too, among other savory bites."
"839"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have friends who refer to this mall as Plaza Sing, and I've started doing the same as well."
"840"|"statement"|"statement"|"But truly tastefully done and i see why peeps flock here!"
"841"|"question"|"question"|"This is where the true skill lies... How can the whole chicken become so delicious inside and outside without being over cooked?"
"842"|"statement"|"statement"|"I like to accompany the dish with pickled green chili, though there are those who swear by the chili concoction in a sqeezy bottle on all tables."
"843"|"statement"|"statement"|"- Despite what previous reviews said, I like The service and good service is rare in Singapore: They are always super friendly and chatty."
"844"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was just overall quite.. bland, without any substantial flavor, and what little flavor it has is saltish and reeks of MSG."
"845"|"statement"|"statement"|"Having been anaesthetised to Singapore's astronomic pricing by now, I thought that ?30-odd for three G&Ts and a beer was actually quite reasonable, particularly given where we were."
"846"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was such a glutton that I ticked so many dishes that they seems to battle for table space when they arrived."
"847"|"statement"|"statement"|"The only down side is, seating is mostly outdoors and there are no A/C, which can be downright unbearable when it's especially hot in Singapore"
"848"|"statement"|"statement"|"I cant give a bad review for good cheap eats and it was located next to the place where I stayed at in SG."
"849"|"statement"|"statement"|"Stellar is not so stellar at fine, envelope-pushing-dining but unfortunately that's exactly what it's trying to do."
"850"|"statement"|"statement"|"Apparently this is where chefs go for their grub."
"851"|"statement"|"statement"|"Good starter pack of food choices of what outdoor foodcourts of Singaporeans have to offer."
"852"|"statement"|"statement"|"and we opted to have it after the food, and they forgot about it, since they processed the first part and threw away the order chit, so when it came to our cakes we have to tell them and get the excuse that they forgot... *sighs*)  ~Food Wise~ The only thing they had going for them was the food, i had egg Benedict, it was really tasty but proportion wise i would preferred if their cakes were a bit smaller."
"853"|"statement"|"statement"|"I tend to find MTO (make to order) food requires a little extra creativity when it comes to creating the perfect salad."
"854"|"statement"|"statement"|"Delicious wine by the glass ($8.50+) is what first caught my attention."
"855"|"statement"|"statement"|"so what if i do not like your recommendations "
"856"|"statement"|"statement"|"The first thing that I wanted when I woke up that first morning in Singapore was to find some place to have some breakfast."
"857"|"statement"|"statement"|"Basic sides and vegetables like mushrooms and noodles are of good quality, not your typical cheap buffet ingredients if you know what I mean!"
"858"|"statement"|"statement"|"Muchachos is a symbol of what happens when you mess with a good thing."
"859"|"statement"|"statement"|"Minus half a star for not having the foie gras slider when we visited last Friday."
"860"|"statement"|"statement"|"This outlet at Raffles City is so big (dont be fooled by what you see from the entrance cos there's a whole lot more tables all the way hidden behind!"
"861"|"statement"|"statement"|"This place also offers private rooms where you can have you own hair metal party playing rock band or look like fools while playing wii."
"862"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were a little surprised when we received the menu as it had not actually looked like a place that would serve only a 7-course meal."
"863"|"statement"|"statement"|"Anyone who does not like bitterness may not like this even as the right amount of milk is added into the coffee."
"864"|"statement"|"statement"|"I liked that the flavours were strong, but what I enjoyed about the dish ended there."
"865"|"statement"|"statement"|"I eat this when I need to feel healthy--it's GREEN!"
"866"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, getting to this place from where I lived was a pain."
"867"|"statement"|"statement"|"The food is quite yummy for what  it is, which is a sort of Asian fusion by way of those Western Chinese takeaways that every student becomes intimately acquainted with and takes full advantage of but never actually can taste again once they leave campus."
"868"|"statement"|"statement"|"But I guess its never a problem when its cooked to perfection."
"869"|"statement"|"statement"|"Ignore the meagre 61st and 62nd floors and head STRAIGHT up to the top - wow, wow and thrice wow, what staggering views!"
"870"|"statement"|"statement"|"My advice is to stick with Teppei at Millennia Walk, where you get a humongous bowl of Kaisendon for about $17 and they creatively offer a salad option if you're on a no-carb diet."
"871"|"statement"|"statement"|"We both enjoyed what we had ordered."
"872"|"statement"|"statement"|"they had 2 incompetent wait staff, who are rightfully, no longer with them."
"873"|"statement"|"statement"|"My friend who lives here was also shocked, so I guess there could be room for improvement."
"874"|"statement"|"statement"|"Ambiance is simple, though it can get a bit loud and echo-y when there's a lot of people."
"875"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't remember what I ate."
"876"|"statement"|"statement"|"Also when you're stuffed, walk about the lobby of the Ritz and admire the whimsical glass creations from Chihuly."
"877"|"statement"|"statement"|"Since a lot of the main ingredients are imported from Italy I can definitely understand why the prices are higher than other places."
"878"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service is friendly, with a smile and they are quick in assisting you when seated."
"879"|"statement"|"statement"|"nothing snooty about him and it was him who personally took responsibility for a simple error, adding wasabi when told not to, by offering to replace the sushi main course even though it was evident that we have already dugged into it despite the mistake."
"880"|"statement"|"statement"|"The performance of food preparation and faux english dining room decor is the novelty here, where the waitresses are dressed in tacky uniforms, they spin and toss your salad in a large metal bowl, and a guy dressed as a chef with a fake medal hung around his neck rolls the prime rib out to your table and carves your serving of meat infront of you."
"881"|"statement"|"statement"|"B, who didn't have a good impression of Lolla, became a convert after this meal."
"882"|"statement"|"statement"|"The bbq is highly recommended as it is cooked over real charcoal and when you do get to know the family they are very warm and friendly."
"883"|"statement"|"statement"|"When my meal was served, my eyes popped out when I saw the portion of the meat, it's probably the most generous portion I come across in Singapore so far."
"884"|"statement"|"statement"|"My daughter who had the onion soup exclaimed that the bowl seemed bottomless, so you could imagine the portions of the servings."
"885"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is one of my favorite places when I don't want the long queue and I just want some peace and quiet meal time."
"886"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm not sure what it was but the paneer is good, not the usual rubbery cube but a soft, tender cheese in a richly spiced and slightly creamy curry."
"887"|"statement"|"statement"|"My particular favorite are the bacon, sausages and the fluffy eggs, which is how I like it when scrambled."
"888"|"statement"|"statement"|"I tend to enjoy my food more when I'm positively disposed & where the service is keen, attentive, efficient or at least pleased to attend to a paying customer!"
"889"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, when a dinner is going to come in at over $500 for two, it really has to meet all marks."
"890"|"statement"|"statement"|"i would highly recommend you to my friends "
"891"|"statement"|"statement"|"3) Pleasant service from the 2 or 3 different guys who served us."
"892"|"statement"|"statement"|"The coconut-curry soup base is rich and should be attacked immediately when it lands on your table while it's still steaming out of the pot."
"893"|"statement"|"statement"|"I wouldn't take a first date or celebrate my anniversary here, but I'll certainly be back for their delectable sushi and good service, at a price tag that doesn't involve cringing when you see the bill."
"894"|"statement"|"statement"|"But the chicken in the kebab is spit roasted chicken and my mouth always waters ever so slightly when I see the succulent, juicy chicken rotating on that spit."
"895"|"statement"|"statement"|"Coming from a person who has tasted soap ( I was about 7 years mind you)."
"896"|"statement"|"statement"|"But it's not meant to compete with more casual places - Hai Di Lao offers a relaxed, quieter, more formal ambiance, where you can leisurely cook and sip at your soup and chat while enjoying your meal."
"897"|"statement"|"statement"|"There were a few times where we were just waiting."
"898"|"statement"|"statement"|"Both the food and service was a mess and I will preface, I am holding Absinthe to fine dining standards because that's what the restaurant markets itself as."
"899"|"statement"|"statement"|"Do order this when you have a big group of people."
"900"|"statement"|"statement"|"A friend who uses Tanuki as his Friday happy hour regular took me there one Friday recently."
"901"|"statement"|"statement"|"Cripsy Spring Roll - This is just what a crispy spring roll should be."
"902"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even when the ramen craze came and swept Singaporeans and foodies around the world off their feet, i remained faithful to my thick chewy white noodles."
"903"|"statement"|"statement"|"But what is heartening to know is that the ingredients used at Spizzico are fresh and the sauces are made from scratch."
"904"|"statement"|"statement"|"But just not up to what I have expected....   A tad disappointed."
"905"|"statement"|"statement"|"Ah Chiang's porridge serves up a comfort porridge dish that has options of pork, intestines, century egg (pei dan), fish and whether you'd like eggs in your porridge or not... With so much more options, take your pick when you get there!"
"906"|"statement"|"statement"|"The restaurant was full of locals, who had spent hours in line to pay their last respects to Mr. Lee who lay temporarily at Parliament, less than km away."
"907"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, as I have suggested, there is really only one thing I eat when I eat Indian - yep, Vindaloo."
"908"|"statement"|"statement"|"Based on what I see other happy customers having, the pastries, sandwiches and drinks here must be pretty good, too."
"909"|"statement"|"statement"|"It is opened by Beppe de Vito who is the one behind il Lido in Sentosa."
"910"|"rhetoric"|"rhetoric"|"Just think of all the superlatives that pepper reviews of the latest French restaurant, Italian joint or Spanish tapas place; why don't those same superlatives apply here?"
"911"|"statement"|"statement"|"And if you need a char kway teow, there's no where else except the one at Zion Road."
"912"|"statement"|"statement"|"If it's pale, it's stale, which is why I always make a note of this."
"913"|"statement"|"statement"|"I can imagine what a hard time this would give single diners, or worse, having to split up lovey-eyed couples by forcing one to queue thereby subjecting them to a painful 20 minutes wait before they reunite!"
"914"|"statement"|"statement"|"Like what other Yelpers mentioned, the buzzer would beep once you sat your butt down on a chair."
"915"|"statement"|"statement"|"No idea what it's called but ask for a white beer that's refreshing."
"916"|"statement"|"statement"|"We went here whilst staying around the corner at the Dorsett hotel and what a wonderful surprise!"
"917"|"statement"|"statement"|"She enjoyed her dish but I didn't particularly enjoy mine as the chunks of beef were very fatty when I was expecting something more tender."
"918"|"statement"|"statement"|"During ramadan, they give priority to the customers who are break fast."
"919"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'll save this place when I want to indulge, but for now, I'm quite happy with the soups at Tanjong Pagar Makret."
"920"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't know if it's because I'm always hungry  when I first sit down or if I just come too often, but the peanuts and pickled veggies that you get before your meal are so wonderful and addicting!!"
"921"|"statement"|"statement"|"FYI, the free glass of sake when you check-in on yelp is just a small shot cup of sake!"
"922"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's not that they weren't good, the skin was silky but perhaps thicker than what i prefer."
"923"|"statement"|"statement"|"(Context as to why I used chai tea latte as a hipster barometer."
"924"|"statement"|"statement"|"Saturday buffet spread is also good enough with grilled meat station, pasta station, pizza, the awesome antipasti bar, dessert spread and a smaller selection of Asian food for those who just need to have Asian cuisine."
"925"|"statement"|"statement"|"All in all, i would recommend this place to people who seeks for a good brunch at central location."
"926"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, it seems hard to get their attention when the crowd started to come in."
"927"|"statement"|"statement"|"20 mins later a waiter came to us and wondered why we never asked for the bill yet."
"928"|"statement"|"statement"|"They are famous for their salted custard bun, eat it immediately when served!"
"929"|"statement"|"statement"|"If the natural sweetness of this delicacy is what you are hankering for, you may like to park yourself next to this station."
"930"|"statement"|"statement"|"Although tasty, I have a preference for long noodles which is probably why I personally rate it slightly lower."
"931"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was milky and flavorsome and was best when coupled with rice."
"932"|"statement"|"statement"|"As we paid our bill, we asked where they will be moving, since Novena Ville is closing."
"933"|"statement"|"statement"|"So, anyone could understand why I was reluctant to visit a place called Super Loco."
"934"|"statement"|"statement"|"For those who have never been here, this restaurant is located within the National Gallery, but remains open until a later time."
"935"|"statement"|"statement"|"the food is great - good ingredients, large portions, strong flavors - and the atmosphere of the place is as lovely as you'd want: there's a certain coziness that comes with the patronage of clearly-regular customers who banter with wait staff and rambunctious children that properly create that rather indescribable something that makes an italian establishment."
"936"|"statement"|"statement"|"Minimalistic decor so not sure what they renovated."
"937"|"statement"|"statement"|"I remember when this place first opened as a tiny little store out of the basement of Plaza Singapura there were many naysayers who said a French-style creperie or soup kitchen would never work."
"938"|"statement"|"statement"|"Wouldn't have ordered if I knew that was what the pudding was made of."
"939"|"statement"|"statement"|"I ordered a coconut and mecca bar which was wrapped up beautifully like a Birthday gift with brown string - I was excited to open it up and when I did, I was met with a beautiful green coloured bar."
"940"|"statement"|"statement"|"They sometimes do specials if you order their specialty pizza, and they were running a great deal when we went there (2 specialty pizzas + 2 starters for $45)."
"941"|"statement"|"statement"|"Probably it is because she knows what to order."
"942"|"statement"|"statement"|"Really one of those rare places with a great atmosphere where you can escape from the bustling city."
"943"|"statement"|"statement"|"I am usually quite lazy when it comes to de-shelling crabs but I gladly make an exception for these brown crabs ($69) which were delicate and meaty."
"944"|"statement"|"statement"|"About the only service is when they serve the Food."
"945"|"question"|"question"|"Hey in additional, where can you find a descent steak for under $25 with 2 side dishes in a restaurant setting in Singapore?"
"946"|"statement"|"statement"|"We did not want to be jammed into a corner already stuffed with guests when the rest of the dining room sat empty."
"947"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't know why this has so few stars but I really like this Mexican restaurant."
"948"|"statement"|"statement"|"Although I find the new creation attractive, the restaurant can lure me further when fewer waving is required on my next visit."
"949"|"statement"|"statement"|"My aunt happened to be in Singapore when I bought the martabak home and she had a taste of it."
"950"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were still looking through the menu when a waitress came up to us to inform us  that a group of 6 had just arrived and we should try to place our orders now to avoid a long wait."
"951"|"statement"|"statement"|"As someone who loves NY/New Haven thin crust pizza, this was a really nice surprise in Singapore."
"952"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was warm and crispy when it arrived at my table."
"953"|"statement"|"statement"|"Level 1, is where one enters through Carlton hotel main lobby."
"954"|"statement"|"statement"|"Was surprised when they brought a cold spring roll."
"955"|"statement"|"statement"|"Dining on spicy Indian food is not optimal when there is no AC."
"956"|"statement"|"statement"|"What makes this review odd to me is that I had two completely different dining experiences in the same dinner...I started out with a very high enjoyment of the restaurant followed by what I thought was totally abysmal."
"957"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure what to expect with this."
"958"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'd say this is the prime example of what I meant by 'creative while staying true to the root'."
"959"|"statement"|"statement"|"We ordered 2 mezz platters, both were underwhelming but what still gives me nightmares was the shawarmas."
"960"|"statement"|"statement"|"Tremendous and excellent selection of Spanish wines - whites, reds, cavas, dulces, sherrys - I was dizzy with what to go with."
"961"|"statement"|"statement"|"(2 for 1)  When they don't have a DJ, they have an awesome setlist of old school R&B jams- which I really enjoy as its very hard to get that anywhere else in Singapore and it goes nicely with the funky, urban style setting of the bar."
"962"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm salivating now even thinking of it... Bill was discounted by a third (33% discount when three dine in)."
"963"|"statement"|"statement"|"The food came quickly even though we were told that they had run out off whole chickens on a Sunday morning at 1130am when they had just opened."
"964"|"statement"|"statement"|"hahahaha great "
"965"|"statement"|"statement"|"I understand why it's considered one of the best Italian restaurants in the world."
"966"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, when we arrived, we learned they were closed on Mondays."
"967"|"statement"|"statement"|"The only reason why I didn't give this review the full 5 stars is because the wait staff was not too friendly or helpful."
"968"|"statement"|"statement"|"I just hope the service and food quality remains just as good, even when they start to get super busy (because I know they will soon enough)."
"969"|"statement"|"statement"|"This should have been an enjoyable relaxed dining experience where we could truly savor their very delicious food."
"970"|"statement"|"statement"|"Make sure you check what you want at the menu outside before you order since they take your order immediately."
"971"|"statement"|"statement"|"Well unless you're one of the privileged 15 pax who has snagged a seat around the open industrial bar."
"972"|"statement"|"statement"|"The value really cannot be beaten and the service was also excellent, even during the weekend rush when the kitchen was overloaded."
"973"|"statement"|"statement"|"The restaurant is in an odd location and its ambiance is not exactly what you'd expect from a fine dining restaurant."
"974"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was light and crispy, which gave a savoury taste when accompanying the rich and creamy durian ice cream."
"975"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's even worth to come here when you have just an stopover at Singapore airport."
"976"|"statement"|"statement"|"The tempura batter and sauce prepared by Ryoshi Sushi is simply outstanding, converting even a friend who does not eat fried food."
"977"|"statement"|"statement"|"After months of being open, they can't seem to be flexible enough to seat a party over 2 people in under 10 minutes-even when there are tables open."
"978"|"statement"|"statement"|"But enough of my childishness and let's talk more about the food, where it actually matters."
"979"|"statement"|"statement"|"The texture of the noodles is probably not as chewy as the other famous wanton noodle place, but when all the above combined the noodles dish itself taste wonderful."
"980"|"statement"|"statement"|"Others: It was full when we arrived so if you've got a big crowd, i would recommend making a reservation!"
"981"|"statement"|"statement"|"There are numerous photos of notable people who have dined there on the wall."
"982"|"statement"|"statement"|"Would definitely go here again when I crave Japanese food."
"983"|"statement"|"statement"|"Honestly, I feel sorry for New Yorkers who have to put up with this kind of condescending service."
"984"|"statement"|"statement"|"Baked Alaska ($16++) Baked ice cream topped with cotton candy, flambeed when served."
"985"|"statement"|"statement"|"I recommended just asking someone who works there for directions."
"986"|"statement"|"statement"|"Unlike other places such as Japan and New York where the cupcake wave has retreated as a popular pastime, cupcakes continue to hold sway in Singapore as more bakeries and cafes enter the scene to fight the sweet pie  cake."
"987"|"statement"|"statement"|"We like to end the meal with their bibimbap, where if you tell them to do it really crispy, they will have that amazing charred bottom like what a good claypot rice or paella gets."
"988"|"question"|"question"|"haha, any others? "
"989"|"statement"|"statement"|"(Giving credit where credit is due)   It's located near my workplace (10 minutes at a moderate walking pace) and I've been making trips here for spontaneous dinners after work, or when I have an hour or so to burn."
"990"|"statement"|"statement"|"They are famous for their lunch time queues - so that's why I prefer going during dinner."
"991"|"statement"|"statement"|"Yes, the tacos aren't bad but at $11 for one when I'm used to $1 (excuse me, with the exchange rate S$1.25) my heart hurts."
"992"|"statement"|"statement"|"That was when Western cuisine was still considered rare in Japan, it is no surprise that they successfully developed a chain with 190 restaurants in Japan alone."
"993"|"statement"|"statement"|"The flavor of the steak itself was fantastic and exactly what you would expect from dry aged meat."
"994"|"statement"|"statement"|"They took a picture for us using their ipad and sent them (one original and one photoshopped with frame) almost immediately to the friend who made reservation."
"995"|"statement"|"statement"|"But, credit where credit's due."
"996"|"statement"|"statement"|"Opened by the same people who started Raw Food Kitchen, Kilo is a foodie's paradise."
"997"|"statement"|"statement"|"Nice place, the ambient is quite refined and the cuisine is what I'd describe as fusion between Chinese and European."
"998"|"statement"|"statement"|"That being said, I went with their recommendations on what to try here and looked around to see what others were ordering."
"999"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's constructed like a market where you can walk around and there're multiple stalls inside - I think you can find any ramen that you can imagine here, so you may have to visit this place several times to actually try all."
"1000"|"statement"|"statement"|"Afterwards, we shared two ala carte mains that get better reviews than what I've listed above."
"1001"|"statement"|"statement"|"We had a reservation from 1230-1430, and while we did take SOME time to order, there was this guy who kept on rushing us and telling us that we had to get out by 2pm..."
"1002"|"statement"|"statement"|"Too many places here sell out and overcook their pasta because that's what most locals prefer, so I like places like Etna and Modesto's who stick to their guns and serve it how it should be served."
"1003"|"statement"|"statement"|"In additional, what is more important is that you can still find authentic local food that has been in business for many years."
"1004"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even when busy, I am usually able to quickly find a table to squeeze into."
"1005"|"statement"|"statement"|"Ok, make sure your head's in the game when you eat anywhere on the river here."
"1006"|"statement"|"statement"|"Again the signage is very subtle so you need to know where you are going, once inside you are greeted & seated in a lounge while you waiter comes to collect you; then you journey begins."
"1007"|"statement"|"statement"|"Understandable as to why it's a favorite in Singapore, but definitely not something I could eat everyday."
"1008"|"statement"|"statement"|"This place is as if it stopped in time where quiet dignity and taking pride in preparing a quality filling meal were cherished."
"1009"|"statement"|"statement"|"Orchard Towers may be a notoriously seedy spot in Singapore but if you are a person who refuses to be deterred by such (over exaggerated) triviality, make you way down for good and affordable Thai fare."
"1010"|"statement"|"statement"|"You will only get that nice surprise when the bill comes."
"1011"|"statement"|"statement"|"They told me their staff is trained in barista skills and I can see a proper coffee machine with grinder to grind fresh but I don't bother with coffee here when Dimbulah is next door."
"1012"|"statement"|"statement"|"They have a long counter where you can sit and see the action in the kitchen."
"1013"|"statement"|"statement"|"Contrary to the other reviewers who went to the first floor, I went to the dining area on the second floor and had a much better (and pricier) experience, which I thoroughly enjoyed."
"1014"|"statement"|"statement"|"The ham and cheese sandwich set with kopi is what I come here for."
"1015"|"statement"|"statement"|"It is quite a well-known Tze-Char stall and was rather crowded when we were there one Tuesday evening."
"1016"|"statement"|"statement"|"As we were there for the first time, I wasn't really sure on where to order and asked one of the staffs about it."
"1017"|"statement"|"statement"|"Sorry guys really not sure what the rave is about here."
"1018"|"statement"|"statement"|"Luke's is a cool hidden place, somewhere that will catch anyone off guard if they have no idea where you are taking them."
"1019"|"statement"|"statement"|"We went when there was only the staff left, so service was quick - almost too quick, however it was attentive and we did not feel rushed after we ordered."
"1020"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't get a lot of things about this place, like why people eat little tortillas with only a piece of duck skin inside."
"1021"|"statement"|"statement"|"Now I see why it has been a hit among the Koreans who care less about the 290kcal each."
"1022"|"statement"|"statement"|"The food is served pretty quick, so it will be a good place for takeaway when in a hurry."
"1023"|"statement"|"statement"|"(if you know what I mean)."
"1024"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's almost as difficult in trying to get a consensus when asking Chicagoans where to find the best deep dish pizza in the city."
"1025"|"statement"|"statement"|"One of the few brunch places in Singapore where you can get some decently priced grubs!"
"1026"|"statement"|"statement"|"And one bite shows you exactly what you're paying for."
"1027"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service may be a little slack depending on where you sit."
"1028"|"statement"|"statement"|"Perhaps they could pack their seaweed separately so it's dry and crispy for you to wrap on when it arrives - Equinox and Swissotel used to serve their sushi at their Sunday brunch buffet like that."
"1029"|"statement"|"statement"|"The chinese local lady at the cashier who spoke mandarin was very friendly and polite."
"1030"|"statement"|"statement"|"Priority were given to ERA agents (not surprising, since Tim Ho Wan is owned by Hersing Corporation, who owns ERA as well) and that the rest will have to wait at the join-in queue (on a Saturday there weren't much ERA agents around)."
"1031"|"statement"|"statement"|"Chinatown in Singapore is not exactly where you'd expect to find a top notch Spanish restaurant."
"1032"|"statement"|"statement"|"The har gao was of generous proportion, but a bit of a miss as the skin got dry and hard when left aside for too long."
"1033"|"statement"|"statement"|"Sometimes you need to be aggressive when ordering."
"1034"|"statement"|"statement"|"No Signboard isn't like your average food centers where a plate of food costs you $3-5."
"1035"|"statement"|"statement"|"I gave my feedback to the staff when paying up, and asked if that was granola or oats."
"1036"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've never had a worse experience in a restaurant and generally I'm pretty positive about restaurants even when they're not great."
"1037"|"statement"|"statement"|"This outlet, while quaintly surrounded by the greenery, is not recommended if you don't drive - well you can take a cab there but will have to call for a cab when you're done."
"1038"|"statement"|"statement"|"Also, the sushi rice is really just mashed together rice paste almost, kind of what you'd expect from machines/not very good rice."
"1039"|"statement"|"statement"|"When we dared protest that this was a different roll than the first, he dogmatically replied, OK, that first one was traditional and the new one is modern, that's what I told you before... Of course, by this point, the first roll was already half eaten..."
"1040"|"statement"|"statement"|"I prefer the good old days when the abalone was sliced."
"1041"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure when the promo ends but i was just there last week and it was still on!"
"1042"|"statement"|"statement"|"This made one felt so unwelcome, especially when the restaurant was less than a quarter full."
"1043"|"question"|"question"|"Now what would you choose?"
"1044"|"statement"|"statement"|"Used the single napkin (that the cutlery usually sits upon when the table is set) provided to put in my lap."
"1045"|"statement"|"statement"|"1 veg manchow soup + 1 veg hakka noodles cost me 25 SGD, which is probably 5 - 10 $ more than what you would expect it to be."
"1046"|"statement"|"statement"|"Tourists, please be careful when coming here!"
"1047"|"statement"|"statement"|"Think of sushi served as a fast food, and you get an idea of what Umisushi is all about."
"1048"|"statement"|"statement"|"4) do come back in good time or stay within visual range after you have placed your order as they will only make your order when they know you are ready to collect immediately."
"1049"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've probably brought too many of my ex-dates here to impress them so nowadays I'm usually here with my friends when we crave for their Pork Parcels or just a bottle of wine to chill our weekend away."
"1050"|"statement"|"statement"|"The broth captures to an exponential degree the pure essence of chicken, reduced down to the potency where every spoonful feels like it must contain the entire flavor and essence of a whole chicken."
"1051"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've had better chicken rice than what I tried here- the chicken was quite dry, although the sauce was good."
"1052"|"statement"|"statement"|"Better selection of flavors than the Shiraz where they always tell me they only have one flavor for the night."
"1053"|"statement"|"statement"|"Especially when they did not know how to answer certain questions they went to ask their manager for the answers rather than saying no so that was a good point."
"1054"|"statement"|"statement"|"So understandably, expectations were high when I finally was able to make a trip to Singapore."
"1055"|"statement"|"statement"|"Dragged here by a friend who claimed the chicken served here is out of this world, I  guess I have to agree with her."
"1056"|"statement"|"statement"|"& I've just returned from Taipei where I tried the original Din Tai Fung."
"1057"|"statement"|"statement"|"For those who dont know, their a similar species to the flounder, just that halibuts grow WAY larger."
"1058"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even when it was delivered, which means it may have lost some quality over being served fresh, it was still one of the top best burgers i've had in awhile."
"1059"|"statement"|"statement"|"I recommend this place for all people who would like to have a gathering in a quiet and comfortable place, although, it is nearby Outram Park station."
"1060"|"statement"|"statement"|"The dumplings are a must (angels wept when I pinched one of my xiaolongbao too hard, allowing some of the broth to spill), but we weren't served a single thing that wasn't really good."
"1061"|"statement"|"statement"|"My friend recommended me to try out this place so why not."
"1062"|"statement"|"statement"|"The price was a bit high for lunch, but I was really happy with the meal and the service, so I'm sure I'll be back when I'm craving a really good burger."
"1063"|"statement"|"statement"|"Moroccan food is something I don't have often so i thought why not."
"1064"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is mainly Thai food and there aren't many local dishes, unlike what the previous reviewer stated."
"1065"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Pavlova with Strawberry Ice Cream might just be what you're looking for if you're looking to gratify your desires for sweets - the Pavlova collapses and dissipates to fine clumps of sugary goodness upon entry to your mouth, and a nice cuppa of Hazelnut Coffee should brighten up your senses, as you swallow its velvety smoothness and take in the nutty fragrance exuded by the cuppa."
"1066"|"statement"|"statement"|"It is definitely a great place for bringing visitors who want to have a sampling of a wide variety of dishes, and you can walk off the huge meal by shopping around orchard road afterwards."
"1067"|"statement"|"statement"|"The steak was what surprised me."
"1068"|"statement"|"statement"|"Although the number of dishes may not looks as many as what is served in Teppei's $80 multi course meal, one really feels as full."
"1069"|"statement"|"statement"|"The ngo hiang is not the best out there, but it's a great side dish to share among when you are there."
"1070"|"statement"|"statement"|"other than the late hours and convenient location in CBD, it's no where like north america's Wendy's lol, so no high expectations here."
"1071"|"statement"|"statement"|"Other dishes are much smaller than what the pictures shows, especially their veggie dish, it looks more like a personal size one."
"1072"|"statement"|"statement"|"Every stands in line on the left where you pick up food and the guy will call you up to the right side to place your order."
"1073"|"statement"|"statement"|"After you place your order and pay, they will give you a buzzer that will vibrate when your food is ready."
"1074"|"statement"|"statement"|"And I got most of the dishes served straight from the chefs, who also explained about the dishes themselves."
"1075"|"statement"|"statement"|"If it's your first time, or you just can't decide what to order, you can try their sampler of 8 flavours and go from there."
"1076"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had the Caramel Pound Cake ($3), which was a thick slice of caramel-based pound cake, with almond ganache (which she adds when you order, for freshness), and the chocolate sauce sealed the deal."
"1077"|"statement"|"statement"|"Anyway, to wit...  What we three had: -  25 sticks of chicken satay -  Nasi Lemak -  Mutton Murtabak -  An assortment of fresh and exotic juices  Everything was generally tasty, well prepared and came out quickly, which I'm sure is an essential component to keeping drunk and rowdy patrons in check."
"1078"|"statement"|"statement"|"No idea what motivates a person to set up a Korean restaurant in a street full of them."
"1079"|"statement"|"statement"|"but this also means that when it is crowded, it may be hard to catch the attention of staff."
"1080"|"statement"|"statement"|"This to other tourists like myself who want a simple and approachable way to enjoy one of Singapore's most famous dishes!"
"1081"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm not a fan of white meat due to typical dryness, but when they ran out of chicken drumstick/leg, I had to settle for breast."
"1082"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have negative 3 star expectations when looking for Mexican food in Singapore so even if it's passable, it's an automatic 3 stars."
"1083"|"statement"|"statement"|"This award-winning stall has and will definitely bring delight and childhood memories to many who have outlived the 60s to 80s."
"1084"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is what happens with this dumpling."
"1085"|"statement"|"statement"|"The galettes were only lukewarm when served, but otherwise they were quite ok."
"1086"|"statement"|"statement"|"There was once where the chawanmushi was served, they were all of different portions."
"1087"|"statement"|"statement"|"Passed by this relatively new halal cafe when it first opened and the menu caught my eye: under noodles it had an option Cockles."
"1088"|"statement"|"statement"|"Another one of my 'must go' places when I'm in Singapore."
"1089"|"statement"|"statement"|"There's no air-conditioning here, so those of you who are fearful of the heat, come in the evenings or you'll have to dine soaked in sweat!"
"1090"|"statement"|"statement"|"From what I remembered of the menu, prices were pretty decent."
"1091"|"statement"|"statement"|"Remember to press the button on the table when one is ready to order."
"1092"|"statement"|"statement"|"The owner is a friendly and bustling uncle who often serves up additional free side dishes to patrons to keep them happy and coming back - smart move!"
"1093"|"statement"|"statement"|"For parents who wants to enjoy these Swedish delicacies, fret not, Fika offers kids meal too!"
"1094"|"statement"|"statement"|"My white European husband makes chapati with more flavour then what we got here."
"1095"|"statement"|"statement"|"We sat down and were promptly served by one of the staff who asked us what we would like to drink."
"1096"|"statement"|"statement"|"$200 minimum if you want to sit down, and you only get the table until 8pm, regardless of what time you sit."
"1097"|"statement"|"statement"|"i prefer meat "
"1098"|"statement"|"statement"|"Both are flavourful and what tops it off for me is the kids' noodle set."
"1099"|"statement"|"statement"|"The  there's the 3) Malay Section with Satay grilled chicken, beef, lamb on a stick with a peanut dipping sauce, super strong and flavorful red onions and hot sauce; BBQ Otak Otak and Sambal Fish; Sayor Lodeh (mixed veggies with coconut gravy; Cucur Sayor, vegetable fritters, and some other items  Then there's the 4) beverage area where you can make an english coffee, espresso, or any kind of a coffee, various drinks from mango to cucumber juice to cool sweet chinese herbal tea."
"1100"|"statement"|"statement"|"Me: Ahhhhhh I see what you did there!"
"1101"|"statement"|"statement"|"Nothing can go wrong when you have three kitchens with very different kinds of food, and this is a good example."
"1102"|"statement"|"statement"|"I will only come here when I want sliced fish in bkt broth or if I am in the area."
"1103"|"statement"|"statement"|"But the staff are very helpful to coordinate a little birthday surprise, when requested."
"1104"|"statement"|"statement"|"The ingredients for the pork noodles were generous with a good mix of meat and inards, those who do not eat pork liver should probably tell them not to put it in."
"1105"|"statement"|"statement"|"Hainanese Chicken Rice is one of the most eaten food when one travels to Singapore."
"1106"|"statement"|"statement"|"Apparently they use a completely different beef for it, which could be why it's higher priced."
"1107"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was late at night, and I was tired and hungry, and using what was left of my energy to explain the different hawker foods to a friend from overseas that I was showing around."
"1108"|"statement"|"statement"|"a moist buchetta with a main chicken and caramelised onion crepes was strangely filling and quite a joy to have especially for one who loves getting his taste buds teased at every bite."
"1109"|"question"|"question"|"So what was part of the classic menu?"
"1110"|"statement"|"statement"|"Perfect for those who always order their drinks as siu dai (less sweet) as this is their normal."
"1111"|"statement"|"statement"|"The food however was alright depending on what you order."
"1112"|"statement"|"statement"|"Have attempted giving other items a go on numerous visits, though I've given up!, spend $90 on flights plus $20 for a night in Ho Chi Minh and you have your cravings satisfied while spending less than you would on a night out on the town in Singapore... that's what I've done anyway."
"1113"|"statement"|"statement"|"Manager's name was - ANNIE Person who answered the phone and managed the queue was LI QUN  Management who read this, feel free to contact me directly to respond to this."
"1114"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not the most uniquely original place in the world, but you can't really blame anyone for not experimenting too much in a locale where rents surely must be astronomical."
"1115"|"statement"|"statement"|"Was constantly ignored by staff standing around, and had the pleasure of a black face when one of them asked if we would like another drink while attempting to remove my unfinished glass of water."
"1116"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was when I finally wanted to cancel the steaks that they came."
"1117"|"statement"|"statement"|"Similarly, if you go to the spa, the receptionists will hassle you about topping up your package ( even when I had close to $800 left) ."
"1118"|"statement"|"statement"|"Hence the reason why I guess my Iced Lemon Tea was a bit too bland."
"1119"|"statement"|"statement"|"Izakaya Tomo serves Japanese cuisine, and I'd say that you will have to try their grilled food items when you get here."
"1120"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've drank KOI a number of times but I honestly dont know what the fuss is all about."
"1121"|"statement"|"statement"|"The waiter was of course apologetic,and I found it hard to lose my cool when scripture was hanging on the wall right in front of me."
"1122"|"statement"|"statement"|"in fact, those who had the beet dish wished they had the scallop dish instead!"
"1123"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's hard for places like this to be exceptional in a day and age where Japanese restaurants are so common and so many offer similar prices with similar qualities."
"1124"|"statement"|"statement"|"The chilli is also pretty good, but the actual chicken is what you're here for."
"1125"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think it starts at $8 or $10  They also have quite a good variety of other traditional Chinese herbal soups but I guess if you're at the Jalan Berseh food centre, do what the locals do and sample some of this dying dish if you already haven't!"
"1126"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even after we spend $85++ pp having the prestige of having their lunch tasting menu here, I have to say I think is money well spent and I will gladly come back again next time when I am in town."
"1127"|"statement"|"statement"|"There aren't alot of ingredients ala what you'd get on the street in Thailand, but the fresh prawns, to-die-for Thai fish cake (only 1 measly piece sliced in half), crunchy beansprouts, minced chicken and garlic is just...perfect."
"1128"|"statement"|"statement"|"For those who are unfamiliar with the combination....it is a very popular American favorite eaten in the Southern states, created to satisfy the late night diners after going to clubs."
"1129"|"statement"|"statement"|"You can choose to sit outdoors by the riverside or indoors where there's a pool table."
"1130"|"statement"|"statement"|"There's no rushed feel of the kopitiams where you'll usually find Ayam Penyets."
"1131"|"statement"|"statement"|"I can't comment on the pork or venison or even the rice, but it surely means a lot when a place can get the simple things right."
"1132"|"statement"|"statement"|"As one other reviewer noted, even when making a reservation, they basically say you have to be out of the restaurant by a certain time and make it a point to re-emphasize the fact while you're there."
"1133"|"statement"|"statement"|"You ever in Singapore, and looking for a place where we could have a good time with great food & drinks, this is a good ticket."
"1134"|"statement"|"statement"|"I, for one, like to go to Thai restaurants where there are a lot of Thais in order to personally certify the restaurant food's authenticity."
"1135"|"statement"|"statement"|"(I daresay that this place actually rivals the more popular Zhen Zhen porridge at Maxwell... probably my favourite porridge place in Singapore at the moment)  Haven't been here for awhile as my workplace has changed but I'll come back here regularly when I'm posted for work near the area!"
"1136"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have always felt that it is nice and calm and have always received good service here even when it is busy."
"1137"|"statement"|"statement"|"My wagyu burger was tasty with a heavy dose of truffle derivatives/seasoning on it, but the meat/fat wasn't mind blowing so it made me wonder why bother using a low grade of wagyu just for marketing purposes."
"1138"|"statement"|"statement"|"They are absolutely out of this world especially when paired with creamy French butter and Bonne Maman jams."
"1139"|"question"|"question"|"can i have a recommendation for chicken rice? "
"1140"|"question"|"question"|"The only down side are -- first, the menu is not so clear Brunch Smalls and Brunch Bigs, who would have known it meant appetizers and mains?"
"1141"|"statement"|"statement"|"At least that's what I'm using it for."
"1142"|"statement"|"statement"|"I always get the pork cheek and shio ramen, but my friend who had the miso was quite disappointed as the miso base doesn't taste much of miso."
"1143"|"statement"|"statement"|"(HI IM IN THIS COOL PLACE WITH AWESOME FOOD AND YOU'RE NOT, is what I sent to my boyfriend in Brunei)  The restaurant is divided into 2 areas, 1 dark and claustrophobic (and you're all sitting at 1 side of the table, facing the bar, but not AT the bar, because there's an alley between you and the bar counter) and 1 bright and airy with a nice view of the chefs grilling the yakitori."
"1144"|"statement"|"statement"|"As someone that was raised in Maryland, which is known for Chesapeake Bay, blue crabs and all cuisine which involve them, I am quite the discerning crab cake connoisseur and actually can't say the crab cakes were what made the meal, but it was good."
"1145"|"statement"|"statement"|"The portions are smaller than that of what you get in the US, but it's just my size!"
"1146"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service was very slow when we walked in, But the chili was to die for!"
"1147"|"statement"|"statement"|"But, it fell well short of what I expect from top-notch steak houses."
"1148"|"statement"|"statement"|"The question why would they want to set up a restaurant in Singapore is beyond me, we don't charge as high as Japan does... hmm... the only reason must be that Singaporeans love our ramen."
"1149"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was topped with the standard array of wood ear fungus, finely chopped spring onions and strands of pickled ginger, but what caused my disappointment was the broth which appeared bland and diluted."
"1150"|"statement"|"statement"|"A joint that everyone who works around China Town would know and frequent, the Soya Sauce Chicken at Chew Kee is long known for its flavour and tender chickens."
"1151"|"statement"|"statement"|"I pity the tourist who shows up at Sin Huat without clear expectations about what he or she is getting into!"
"1152"|"statement"|"statement"|"Thank God for this lady who saved the day!"
"1153"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't really get why people seem to enjoy this - you can hardly hold a proper conversation at all given the noise of the crowd."
"1154"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's lemak enough and if you like hum, the serving is pretty generous Prices are a bit higher than average but there are meal combos where you can get an otah and a drink with your laksa."
"1155"|"statement"|"statement"|"I owe it to Ms. Eunice Quek from The Straits Times where her review on the restaurant was published."
"1156"|"statement"|"statement"|"Drinks - Gummiberry (definitely a must try for ladies who love meringue)."
"1157"|"statement"|"statement"|"I tried the pulled pork first as that was what I was eyeing on when glancing at the menu."
"1158"|"statement"|"statement"|"You pick and choose what you want and you're off to the cashier - like a cafeteria style dining."
"1159"|"statement"|"statement"|"We visited Neko No Niwa everytime we went to Singapore and it was a great feeling to get to know amazing people who really cared about cats wellbeing."
"1160"|"statement"|"statement"|"Food is great, place is clean, buffet style, and pay what you think is fair."
"1161"|"statement"|"statement"|"The second floor is more compact and better suited to smaller groups who prefer privacy."
"1162"|"statement"|"statement"|"services are available  ritz carlton delivers fully stocked amenities with a request list should you require anything further  for those who enjoy the extra touch, they offer turn down service!!"
"1163"|"statement"|"statement"|"This just really wasn't what I was looking for and what I think the restaurant was aiming for with it's menu."
"1164"|"statement"|"statement"|"I wonder who makes corn tortillas in Singapore."
"1165"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was barely two thirds full, and some of the mussels looked like they had shrunk to the size of clams :( When one of the managers or team leaders sent our beers, I asked her if she could provide some feedback to the kitchen- that it's quite sad to open a pot of mussels and find it only two thirds full."
"1166"|"statement"|"statement"|"Back in San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bakery totally states that they have the best egg tarts and makes patrons wait from their loooooong vacation to finally get them (I won't go into that story as there were about 3-5 times throughout a calendar year where we went to the store and they were on vacation)."
"1167"|"statement"|"statement"|"I always get the black pepper bowl, it's a good quick fix for when Ippudo just seems too far away and too long a wait."
"1168"|"statement"|"statement"|"I recently brought some friends from the states who had never been to Asia here."
"1169"|"statement"|"statement"|"I expected a lot when I visited, and had middle class stake."
"1170"|"statement"|"statement"|"It sounds nitpicky but I have eaten at traditional sushi restaurants for work where my table isn't at or near the counter and the waiters bent over backwards to make sure our reactions to the food were conveyed to the chef."
"1171"|"statement"|"statement"|"I look forward to trying their duck and update this review but what a splendid meal of meat over here!"
"1172"|"statement"|"statement"|"They have $88 bottles of champagne, which I suspect why my boss comes here, he knows how much we all drink."
"1173"|"statement"|"statement"|"Especially those stylish worker-types who might want to come here to unwind during lunch hours."
"1174"|"statement"|"statement"|"We will go back when we return to Singapore from California!"
"1175"|"statement"|"statement"|"youre just a bot "
"1176"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm normally not impressed when hotels try to offer local fare but I have to say their local food is pretty good."
"1177"|"statement"|"statement"|"I went because I remember D&D from my time in New York where I occasionally bought something."
"1178"|"statement"|"statement"|"Other than the outdoor seats, they also have an air-conditioned second floor where you can enjoy the delectable dessert in better comfort."
"1179"|"statement"|"statement"|"So when I finally received my last paycheck for my summer internship there, I decided to splurge  on Singapore's speciality, after hearing from my coworkers that Jumbo had the best/most famous chili crab to offer."
"1180"|"statement"|"statement"|"We had no idea what to expect, but loved the fact that we could sample so many different wines to our hearts' desires."
"1181"|"statement"|"statement"|"They get the small things right and that's what keeps me coming back."
"1182"|"statement"|"statement"|"I am not a keen fan of expensive ingredients and thus I cannot comment on the taste of some food but those who had them enjoyed the delicacies."
"1183"|"statement"|"statement"|"?I have tried several boat noodles stalls to curb my craving for Thai boat noodles but the taste didn't come close to what i had in Bangkok."
"1184"|"statement"|"statement"|"For the beef patty, I ordered it medium rare as that is what I normally choose for burgers."
"1185"|"statement"|"statement"|"Also, when we wanted to ask a waiter to take a photo for our group, there was none in sight."
"1186"|"statement"|"statement"|"There were at least 50 photos plastered on the walls, of celebrities who have slurped in these seats including Anthony Bourdain."
"1187"|"statement"|"statement"|"The porkbone soup is milky and flavourful, the mala is not oily like what u might find elsewhere!"
"1188"|"question"|"question"|"Verdict:  Spaghetti Amatriciana - Why is the spaghetti so thick??!"
"1189"|"statement"|"statement"|"Though I did savour each tasty morsel, it was gone too soon, and all I had left was the simple soup to end what was a very tasty meal for just three dollars."
"1190"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service was also impeccable, they were pretty much stealthy ninjas who refilled your teapot while you were conversing."
"1191"|"statement"|"statement"|"Le wife had what I think was their signature dish, the cold angel hair with caviar."
"1192"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have my Turkish haunts when I have that itch for endless eggplants, but talking about true comfort meeting epicurean, try this 'middle eatery/ modern eastern' establishment."
"1193"|"question"|"question"|"Uhhhhhh what happened to this place?"
"1194"|"question"|"question"|"How is this possible when you have to dig in with your hands???"
"1195"|"statement"|"statement"|"But when it comes to the one at Old Airport Road Market, you will be seeing me joining the long 'snake' queue."
"1196"|"statement"|"statement"|"Rum and raisin macaron/Fruit Cake/Orange Flower   In all, these Xmas flavors like fruit cake are not exactly what I prefer but is certainly a welcome innovation."
"1197"|"statement"|"statement"|"They have some wasabi prawns which are pretty much consistently good no matter where I've eaten them."
"1198"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm not so sure why the menu description says it comes with 'cracked wheat', since the plate seemed more like a generous platter of vegetables, protein and carbohydrates."
"1199"|"statement"|"statement"|"it was raining and the les amis group provides valet parking, so why not."
"1200"|"statement"|"statement"|"Came here with a friend from San Fran who was craving some authentic Cantonese food - and since we were willing to break the piggy bank (quite a few, in fact!"
"1201"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had heard a bit about FIne Palate but had never had a chance to stop by until a few weeks ago when I came with a friend for a work photo shoot."
"1202"|"statement"|"statement"|"I could have had Din Tai Fung in Taipei two days ago at the location where Tom Cruise learned to make the juicy pork dumplings with the owner...but I was staying too far away from the city."
"1203"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'd just like to say anyone who says the Singapore Sling is worth the S$30 you pay for it is a frigign liar and attempting to look pretentious because they are okay with paying that much for gin and juice (No Snoop Dogg or Snoop Lion, depends on how old you are)."
"1204"|"statement"|"statement"|"Location isn't ideal for me - a very minor detail as getting around is so so easy no matter where you are."
"1205"|"statement"|"statement"|"Given that it is one of the few places that does sell martabak manis, its a bit expensive (esp comparing to how much cheaper it is in Indonesia -__-) but when you have a craving you have to fulfill it ^_^."
"1206"|"statement"|"statement"|"They didn't have much seating so we were seated by the kitchen across from the main location in what seems like an extension across the road..."
"1207"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had visited Central many times when it was at Ngee Ann City and then twice when it was at 313."
"1208"|"statement"|"statement"|"It offers both alfresco and indoor dining, and I tend to choose the former especially on days when the weather is good - it offers a great vantage point for people watching on crowded afternoons as well."
"1209"|"statement"|"statement"|"Anyways, was introduced this place by Q (he is my trusty source of makan joints and whatnot), and we actually went there on the 3rd day of CNY, but it was closed when we got there."
"1210"|"statement"|"statement"|"But if you are savory sort, you're not that far away from the fresh seafood counter where you'd be greeted with neat stacks of shellfish and crustaceans, sashimi, sushi, and cold cuts."
"1211"|"statement"|"statement"|"I re-discovered this a few years back when I came to this area for Zumba classes, and have been back a few times when I have craving for Indian Rojak."
"1212"|"statement"|"statement"|"This place is not the typical super loud Japanese restaurant when the waiters yell welcome, thank you...etc non-stop."
"1213"|"statement"|"statement"|"Especially, when you're dipping the Kaya Toast bread in the eggs... Yummmmmmyyyy."
"1214"|"statement"|"statement"|"The queue was a bit of a put off but you know what they say, good things must wait!"
"1215"|"statement"|"statement"|"The BBQ sauce accompanying it was just perfect - a little spicy and not sweet unlike what you get with BBQ meats."
"1216"|"statement"|"statement"|"2 stars for inattentive staff who either couldn't be bothered or just poorly trained."
"1217"|"statement"|"statement"|"it's really healthy, especially when you ask for fatty char siew!"
"1218"|"statement"|"statement"|"A word of advice, be down there when you are feeling ready to spend and order without looking at the price list."
"1219"|"statement"|"statement"|"It didn't look like a very special place at first, and it was barely filled when we reached there."
"1220"|"statement"|"statement"|"The skin itself isn't paper thin, but when biting into the xiao long bao, you can enjoy the soft texture of the skin and behind it, you find a very savoury soup and chunk of meat embedded in the xiao long bao."
"1221"|"statement"|"statement"|"Andre boasts fresh sublime ingredients that marry well with each other (I normally think that when people use the word marry with regards to food, they're a pretentious lot!"
"1222"|"statement"|"statement"|"Located in middle of a row of shophouses, next UE Square, there is this restaurant who offers this traditional comfort food till late at night."
"1223"|"statement"|"statement"|"They were also very patient and helpful when it came to picking a sauce for the wings."
"1224"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was in the process of calling them to place an order from within their own venue when a server walked by!"
"1225"|"statement"|"statement"|"So, strict no no...for people who don't eat beef."
"1226"|"statement"|"statement"|"Personally, I felt that the escargots could do with a little bit more of the garlic butter, nonetheless, what I had was pleasant enough."
"1227"|"statement"|"statement"|"Stamp your own loyalty card and when you buy 6 cups, get a FREE one - amazing!"
"1228"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was there when Park Bench Deli first opened its door (in July) along the buzzling Teluk Ayer street and thought I'll never go back."
"1229"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Singaporean chef was not 'grumpy' or moody or what not, but instead, very friendly."
"1230"|"statement"|"statement"|"Same taste what i had back in Coimbatore, India."
"1231"|"question"|"rhetoric"|"If you're thinking why Japanese drinks?"
"1232"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm not really a buffet person, given that my *ahem* capacity for food has lowered over the years, but when someone gets me to Carousel, I can't turn it down."
"1233"|"statement"|"statement"|"I just sampled the grilled cheese sandwich and it was good for what it was."
"1234"|"statement"|"statement"|"I enjoy a good dining experience and who I can only presume was the owner or manager of Moma Kongs delivered this, he had a really people personality too him when taking our order, ensuring he got photos of all the diners for his patrons for his ever growing marque, etc."
"1235"|"statement"|"statement"|"To summarize, going to Whale & Cloud is like finding really good coffee at a friend of a friend's house and within that house is a secret hiding place where all the cool toys are kept."
"1236"|"statement"|"statement"|"Decorated beautifully combining french and japanese influences, it creates its own little enclave where one can sit at ease to enjoy a cup of coffee and a slice of cake while people-watching or browsing through a book or magazine."
"1237"|"statement"|"statement"|"First of all, when we arrived, what greeted us was the elegant and relaxing interior."
"1238"|"statement"|"statement"|"From the people who brought us Potato Head Club in Jakarta and Bali, comes the smaller, quainter folkier version here in Singapore."
"1239"|"statement"|"statement"|"Google and you'll see what I mean."
"1240"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's hard to get excited about the various offerings here, but I do think it has a nice location for afterwork drinks when you work along Cecil street."
"1241"|"statement"|"statement"|"Signature dishes - Nihari and the Half Kadhai...I know these guys so well when I go, the urgency is to find a seat."
"1242"|"statement"|"statement"|"I absolutely hate it when hawkers serve 3-day-old coleslaw, thinking they can get away with it by refrigerating it."
"1243"|"statement"|"statement"|"So when a friend came into town for work and wanted Asian food, I decided it would be a good opportunity to try it, since it's sit-down place with service, AC, and local food."
"1244"|"statement"|"statement"|"It is probably about 20% to 50% more than what the food would usually cost in an average hawker centre."
"1245"|"statement"|"statement"|"The rice was good, but the texture was different from what I usually expect - it was less firm here, but still very good."
"1246"|"statement"|"statement"|"You never want a restaurant where you have to track down staff to get a drink."
"1247"|"statement"|"statement"|"The supermarket with a TV area where kids can sit on a square mat and watch animations, how KAWAII!"
"1248"|"statement"|"statement"|"Given what I went through to get Sunday brunch in Kampong Glam, Stateland deserves 5 stars."
"1249"|"question"|"question"|"so where doo wee goo too?"
"1250"|"statement"|"statement"|"Spize is where you go for a post-party chow down."
"1251"|"statement"|"statement"|"We got excited when we saw Marche Movenpick next to our hotel thinking that it would be like the ones in Toronto, Canada and Lausanne, Switzerland."
"1252"|"statement"|"statement"|"No reason for you not to finish them when you already took them."
"1253"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not for the faint of heart...if you don't want to guess when your food is done cooking on a rock don't do it."
"1254"|"statement"|"statement"|"While it's still delicious and tender, the meat wasn't as melt in your mouth tender as it was when I first tried it a few years ago."
"1255"|"statement"|"statement"|"I still come here from time to time when I want straight up decent margaritas or other poison spiked with lots of tequila, and snacky food."
"1256"|"statement"|"statement"|"There are times when the sashimis are really really fresh as well."
"1257"|"statement"|"statement"|"Best time to get around there to having your bowl of prawn noodles is around 8pm, where the broth has nicely matured with a rich taste of prawn."
"1258"|"statement"|"statement"|"But then I meet professional food reviewers who have never heard of it."
"1259"|"statement"|"statement"|"Bread is the first thing I think of when it comes to Paris Baguette Cafe so I was quite surprised to learn that it has launched 4 new bing su."
"1260"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm just telling you what they serve and that I enjoyed the result, but do acknowledge there are many different ways to go about it."
"1261"|"statement"|"statement"|"The set lunch I ordered was definitely above what I expected!"
"1262"|"statement"|"statement"|"They have recently started to absorb both GST and Service Charge so what you see (on the menu), is what you pay."
"1263"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure what drew me here, given that I'm not exactly the biggest fan of chicken."
"1264"|"statement"|"statement"|"The process is simple- find a table to sit at, check out the menu (small ones are provided at each table), order/pay at the cashier where they'll give you a buzzer and then pick up your food at the counter when it's ready."
"1265"|"statement"|"statement"|":)  For those who are sticking around for this review, Hi!"
"1266"|"statement"|"statement"|"My favorite is the sliced pork in soup, where the soup is the same base, but has additional ingredients which makes it more tasty."
"1267"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think $35 should have been the absolute ceiling given what we were served."
"1268"|"statement"|"statement"|"And that's where it went off track."
"1269"|"statement"|"statement"|"From USA so owner was extremely helpful with what to order."
"1270"|"question"|"question"|"So whats a former New Yorker to do when it comes to GOOD Italian food in Singapore?"
"1271"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"My husband and I love the puzzled looks we get when we tell them we love to go to Orchard Towers for...dinner??"
"1272"|"statement"|"statement"|"that would be what you HAVE to get here."
"1273"|"statement"|"statement"|"Nevermind that the entire packed-out restaurant stopped what they were all doing to stare at us for a solid 20 seconds."
"1274"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was moderately okay, and it did remind me of the copious amounts of pasta I used to eat (and make myself) when I was in the States."
"1275"|"statement"|"statement"|"Recommended by a taxi driver and he was raving about it in the car and I can totally understand why now."
"1276"|"statement"|"statement"|"I sat there for a good 10 minutes and tried to figure out why it was so bland."
"1277"|"statement"|"statement"|"Ok so i admit we used a G****** coupon for this Saturday lunch but after our visit today  we will become regulars when in this part of the city."
"1278"|"statement"|"statement"|"If the 3 waitresses are busy and hence delay the service which is forgivable but all I saw was 3 waitresses look a bit lost and don't know what they are doing, walking up and down for nothing."
"1279"|"statement"|"statement"|"She asked us to wait while she clears the table, and later sat us near a corner where we can comfortably push the pram to."
"1280"|"statement"|"statement"|"What's popular now is boneless chicken rice, where they skillfully remove all the bones, either from the breast or thighs and serve it beautifully presented on a plate."
"1281"|"statement"|"statement"|"Here is where we opted to share a cheese plate."
"1282"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"Made my reservation via the ever trusty Chope, but based on the crowd when I got there, I don't think you'll need one... still, I always think it's better to be safe than sorry right?"
"1283"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't know what is in the sauce (light colored and very minimal) but it sure packed a punch."
"1284"|"statement"|"statement"|"Perhaps I'm used to the U.S. portions, when served I was thinking what a small bowl for the price."
"1285"|"statement"|"statement"|"came here a few times when having meetings in the Pan Pacific."
"1286"|"statement"|"statement"|"Spotted lots of Japanese ladies and men having lunches and tea breaks there and it sure added to the whole jap muji-like feel of the place and that is why this place has 5 stars from me (plus the clean washrooms and plugs too)!"
"1287"|"statement"|"statement"|"They never seem to have it in stock, and the waitress gave me such an attitude when I asked when they would have it again."
"1288"|"statement"|"statement"|"This shop is the other reason why I'd visit Adam Road Food Centre (apart from the Nasi Lemak, of course)."
"1289"|"question"|"question"|"You know how at most food joints, where you have to portion your meat and vegetables accordingly to your carbs?"
"1290"|"question"|"question"|"how do i qualify for the promotion? "
"1291"|"statement"|"statement"|"After many a meal at hawker centres, my friend and I decided that some wings were what we were missing in our lives."
"1292"|"statement"|"statement"|"And when they say gourmet, they mean gourmet."
"1293"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is my safe brunch place, when we can't quite make up our minds where to go, we always end up here."
"1294"|"statement"|"statement"|"I guess I was expecting more on the menu but when the choices were limited to just burrito, burrito bowl, quesadilla and buffalo wings, it kinda deflated my enthusiasm."
"1295"|"question"|"question"|"In a related aside, where is the finesse in a rice bowl with supermarket fish-cake, egg and basic enoki mushrooms?"
"1296"|"statement"|"statement"|"Paying only with the manager who don't have any idea about nothing!"
"1297"|"statement"|"statement"|"Namely, Whoever has the most toys when he dies wins."
"1298"|"statement"|"statement"|"Hmmm...maybe they are looking to a hire a freelance graphic designer who could help with that...I'm available!"
"1299"|"statement"|"statement"|"The kitchen is glass, but you can't really see from your seat, only when you're walking in/out."
"1300"|"question"|"question"|"Well, truly what do you think the odds are of having tacos in Singapore?"
"1301"|"statement"|"statement"|"Colleagues who have ordered the teh tarik say that it's quite good."
"1302"|"statement"|"statement"|"The cleaners are generally fast enough when clearing cutlery from previous customers, but there is no place to return your own trays to speed up the process."
"1303"|"statement"|"statement"|"Lastly, the Tyrwhitt's Wings... Who doesn't like Teriyaki infused chicken wings."
"1304"|"statement"|"statement"|"I particularly like it when i eat it with the ice cream."
"1305"|"statement"|"statement"|"and was eager to try it out here when I read that they opened about a month ago."
"1306"|"statement"|"statement"|"Tiara, the young lady who is running the place for the family is very sweet, curious to my palette as an American pizza lover and accommodating for any questions I had regarding the menu and the city in general!"
"1307"|"statement"|"statement"|"I usually come here for a meal with my girlfriends when we don't feel like having too heavy."
"1308"|"statement"|"statement"|"knowing what to expect I might be able to use some condiments to touch it up a bit in the future."
"1309"|"statement"|"statement"|"Food is good but slightly overpriced for what it actually is."
"1310"|"statement"|"statement"|"They have beer samplers if you can't decide what you like."
"1311"|"statement"|"statement"|"Those who are adverse to spicy food will be able to handle this pot easily as the curry is NOT spicy at all."
"1312"|"statement"|"statement"|"I didn't think much of this one, but when the day I decided to venture out to get my chilli crab fix turned out to be a stormy day filled with rainstorms, I had to choose the easiest to get to."
"1313"|"statement"|"statement"|"It would be great if there were separate male and female cubicles, because sometimes I really have to pee (especially when I drink) but then there might be some guy shitting inside :(."
"1314"|"statement"|"statement"|"The only problem with an open kitchen, as well as the background music, was that I couldn't hear much when the chefs introduced the dishes."
"1315"|"statement"|"statement"|"(Ok, here is where I got a bit sarcastic, I admit that)."
"1316"|"statement"|"statement"|"It all costs no more or less, but you get what you drink for a flat price."
"1317"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was given a table near the front where the glass windows were and that was good."
"1318"|"statement"|"statement"|"I immediately asked her where she bought it from and that was the time when i first introduced to Tampopo."
"1319"|"statement"|"statement"|"I go to Carl's Junior when I need my dirty, oily, greasy fix."
"1320"|"statement"|"statement"|"We ordered a lamb pide after plucking up the courage to ask the people at the table next to us what it was they were eating."
"1321"|"statement"|"statement"|"TRY IT WHEN YOU ARE IN SINGAPORE!"
"1322"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service is excellent and prices are fair for what it's worth ($50-60 pp with no alcohol, although we did order bottled water)."
"1323"|"statement"|"statement"|"The others are also good though not as good as what you can get in some well known hawker stalls."
"1324"|"statement"|"statement"|"Don't refuse the sambal when they ask."
"1325"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's a very casual setting for days where you just want somewhere to relax and ignore the world."
"1326"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't know what Hawaiian food is, but at this Maison we tried their burgers, salads, and soup."
"1327"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was topped with duck confit but if you're feeling like that, I would highly recommend instead to go for the mixed charcuterie platter where you get alot more with a wide selection of tender quality cold cuts."
"1328"|"statement"|"statement"|"Walking around trying to think of what to eat for dinner, my husband pointed to this tiny shop."
"1329"|"statement"|"statement"|"Overall much to expensive for what you get."
"1330"|"statement"|"statement"|"Afterwards, they give you a questionnaire about what you ate and THEN show you on a tablet what all the dishes were."
"1331"|"statement"|"statement"|"A bit pricey since we are paying for some historicity here, especially when you get to taste some of the old unchanged flavours dim sum in a old HK setting."
"1332"|"statement"|"statement"|"This problem is INTENSIFIED when purchased through McDelivery."
"1333"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think avoiding the Beef Hor Fun for a couple of visits was probably working in my waistline's favour what can I say."
"1334"|"statement"|"statement"|"It felt like a place where one could relax and chat with friends for hours."
"1335"|"statement"|"statement"|"The ordering system is too high tech for me and I find it takes longer when the place is not busy."
"1336"|"statement"|"statement"|"The reason why I love their Lor Mee so much is because of their thick gravy sauce."
"1337"|"statement"|"statement"|"My husband, who often has half a bowl of soup left over in his ramen bowls, polished off the whole bowl of splendid broth."
"1338"|"statement"|"statement"|"I am also not sure what made it cajun."
"1339"|"statement"|"statement"|"Spizza is a decent place serving thin crust pizzas - great for dining there when you're not feeling particularly hungry."
"1340"|"question"|"question"|"I've seen the world, done it all Had my cake now Diamonds, brilliant, in Bel-Air now Hot summer nights, mid July When you and I were forever wild The crazy days, city lights The way you'd play with me like a child  Will you still love me When I'm no longer young and beautiful?"
"1341"|"statement"|"statement"|"The heavy taste of the soup is one of the reason why customers keep returning back to the place."
"1342"|"statement"|"statement"|"Great place for a meetup with friends where food isnt the focus."
"1343"|"statement"|"statement"|"First of all they do not serve the three meats shabu shabu, who knows why, despite the fact it is on the menu!!!!!"
"1344"|"statement"|"statement"|"Expensive for what we got."
"1345"|"question"|"rhetoric"|"If your restaurant is empty, why were some menu items unavailable?"
"1346"|"statement"|"statement"|"Give yourself some time because either one of these food courts is make you spend some time walking around and just looking for what they have."
"1347"|"question"|"question"|"Served with a small scoop of what tasted like bread-pudding ice-cream and some crumbs of what we speculated were nuts, oatmeal, cookie crumbles and crust of carrot cake?"
"1348"|"statement"|"statement"|"Another 10 mins later when we checked with them again, we found out that they forgot our order (which they didn't tell us directly but we saw and overheard the commotion)."
"1349"|"statement"|"statement"|"I find it incredibly offensive when restaurants try to pull a fast one on their customers."
"1350"|"statement"|"statement"|"Another reason why its one of my favourite joints to eat at around the CBD area - I've never had to wait or hover around for a table - it seems that this place attracts a greater take-away crowd, so there's always plenty of room for you to sit down for lunch there."
"1351"|"statement"|"statement"|"They lead you to a table where they help you feel around and get acquainted with your space."
"1352"|"statement"|"statement"|"nice brunch places, please "
"1353"|"statement"|"statement"|"The space is quite open and there is plenty of space for larger groups from what I can remember."
"1354"|"statement"|"statement"|"I remember coming here when I was a kid with my dad and his co workers."
"1355"|"statement"|"statement"|"It gave the dessert a sweet ending when we got to the bottom."
"1356"|"statement"|"statement"|"Living in Singapore, I end up eating more chicken and pork than seafood or beef, and finally there was a night where I wanted to grab a steak but not necessarily pluck down $200 at Cut."
"1357"|"statement"|"statement"|"For me, it was really worth it especially when you consider the creativity, mixture of ingredients, presentation and passion that went into each dish."
"1358"|"statement"|"statement"|"My kids love the outdoor playgrounds that's why I come here whenever I need to relax or meet up with someone."
"1359"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is the only place that I know who has this choice."
"1360"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's a family oriented restaurant where there's a children's section near the roast food section for kids to play, run around and eat at."
"1361"|"statement"|"statement"|"My friends and I love it so much that the waitress got a big shocked when we order 5 servings of it for a table of 8  (15pcs)"
"1362"|"question"|"question"|"You know the ones where they ask you three times if you really like spicy?"
"1363"|"statement"|"statement"|"The place was packed and waiting time was about 45 minutes when I overheard a staff telling a customer as I was leaving the place."
"1364"|"statement"|"statement"|"For the rest who prefer a combination of rice and noodles, definitely order their set meals which serve up a generous half portion of ramen and a half portion of rice."
"1365"|"statement"|"statement"|"I wait eagerly to see what will be up next."
"1366"|"statement"|"statement"|"I wasn't sure what they hype was with Cold Stone."
"1367"|"statement"|"statement"|"I wish they had more Dong Bei dishes, but it seems that the dishes here are the ones probably what the locals will pay premium for."
"1368"|"statement"|"statement"|"The vatos burrito with kalbi(can choose different meats) was ok. Not great but ok. Kalbi, kimchi, fries etc sounds like it should be good but actually it's a bit too solid a food when compacted together."
"1369"|"statement"|"statement"|"Well, You just don't want to count your calories when you are eating it."
"1370"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is the cleanest outdoor food centre and they even have this foreign concept where people are encouraged to return their own trays after their meal."
"1371"|"statement"|"statement"|"Always  want to drop by this small store to get a set of takoyaki when visit orchard."
"1372"|"statement"|"statement"|"I heard all about the chicken rice spat and I came to the Maxwell Food Centre (in late Dec 2012) to try Ah Tai's chicken rice to find out for myself what the commotion was about... but I only heard crickets."
"1373"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just a note of caution if you're thinking of heading here for bak chor mee: They're supposed to close at 9 pm, but their actual closing time is when they run out of ingredients for the day, which, on the day I visited, was 7.30 pm."
"1374"|"statement"|"statement"|"Well my response would be that a restaurant is only tested through their handing of issues, and their interaction with their customers, not when someone rates 5 starts for ordering a glass of wine, which requires no thought, I don't feel this is representational of the restaurants ability to serve, and thus earn their 5 star rating."
"1375"|"statement"|"statement"|"The passion of several entrepreneurs, who has worked in various sectors including F&B, advertising, hotels and even in fitness lead to the formation of an industrial-chic cafe called My Awesome Cafe."
"1376"|"statement"|"statement"|"Apparently, a little history lesson from Stefan, the uncle who owns Mongkok fell out with his nephew who then established that spot and both pointing fingers at each other that each had stolen each others' recipe."
"1377"|"statement"|"statement"|"The waitresses must have refilled my tea cup 7 times, but it was an opaque cup, so they must have been paying attention to the angle of the cup when I was sipping in order to guess how much liquid was still inside."
"1378"|"statement"|"statement"|"From what I hear, Ye Yint Cafe has been around for a long time and was recommended to be authentic by some Burmese people I've met out here."
"1379"|"statement"|"statement"|"also, when she made the reservation, the restaurant was adamant that there was a a strict dress code."
"1380"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm caught in between opinions when it comes to this store and here's my experience -  I was lucky enough to join the queue on a Saturday morning minutes before noon and only queued about 30mins for this ( I heard it can be up to an hour plus)."
"1381"|"statement"|"statement"|"Good when you managed to get hold of someone, bad because had to wait a while before someone noticed you are ready to order."
"1382"|"statement"|"statement"|"At that moment when I took my first bite of it, I knew my taste buds were in for a treat (and so is my tummy) for the night."
"1383"|"statement"|"statement"|"However what I got in the end was a small salad with some mediocre pork belly on top."
"1384"|"statement"|"statement"|"The food smelled really good from where I was and so I decided to grab a bite there."
"1385"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service - there isn't any queue on most days but even when there is one, it moves quickly."
"1386"|"statement"|"statement"|"Which is to say, pop by when you're hungry and don't feel like kebab, or something a bit upmarket at other parts of the Arab St area."
"1387"|"statement"|"statement"|"On a visit to Singapore one must visit the famous Long Bar at The Raffles Hotel where you must treat yourself to the popular & extremely expensive & original Singapore Sling."
"1388"|"statement"|"statement"|"A lot of the dissatisfaction also has to do with our sushi chef, who moved in a very inefficient manner, wasting a lot of time putting something down, picking it up, putting it down again, cutting tuna, then cutting ika, then going back to cut tuna... and made us mildly concerned since he was opening cupboards and doors in between cutting raw fish and making sushi (all sans gloves of course, which is expected), and using the same cloth to wipe his cutting board, his knife, his chopsticks, his hands, and his forearm."
"1389"|"statement"|"statement"|"aunty can be sweet too, IF you follow a few simple rules: 1) do stay at least one metre away from the stall when queuing."
"1390"|"statement"|"statement"|"I should have realized that when I was getting a glass of French Merlot in Singapore for $13."
"1391"|"statement"|"statement"|"For days when we require meat for parties, I'll get the whole slab of good quality meat back home to serve."
"1392"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were torn between two wines and not only did he explain both to us, he also helped us make a choice quickly - by actually suggesting something and not simply saying 'it's up to what you prefer'."
"1393"|"statement"|"statement"|"The dish was warm when it arrived to our table."
"1394"|"statement"|"statement"|"Overall, if you're one of those people who tries things out for the reputation, do it."
"1395"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was around lunch time and there were many other brave knights who had braved the CBD heat to Icon and were waiting be around for their orders."
"1396"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service was friendly and very brisk, you don't have to really wait long for your drinks to arrive, even when there's a large crowd."
"1397"|"statement"|"statement"|"Considering the ambiance and price, this is a great place to go for special occasions with the family, or celebrating a milestone birthday or job promotion with friends who are picky!"
"1398"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure what a reservation means, thought it meant reserved to me."
"1399"|"statement"|"statement"|"You will be presented with the various options of meat and the server explains to you what the specifics of the meat are.I personally like the 'Bone in Filet Mignon' medium rare paired with a nice red wine."
"1400"|"statement"|"statement"|"Of course none of this matters when you live in Singapore and develop a craving for some, any good US barbecue joints."
"1401"|"statement"|"statement"|"4) Fresh Orange Juice - unlike many restaurants and even hotels that advertise fresh orange juice, this is actual fresh orange juice (not sure why this is a foreign concept given how big Singaporeans are on fresh juice) 5) Coffee - good coffee but not the biggest fan of their iced coffee for some reason  Highly recommend coming here for good bagel or pastrami sandwich."
"1402"|"statement"|"statement"|"As a hard truth, the chicken tasted best when doused with the bourbon maple butter sauce."
"1403"|"question"|"question"|"Want some really good hand-made soba that's comparable to what you can get in Japan?"
"1404"|"statement"|"statement"|"Besides they don't tell you what is the food about."
"1405"|"statement"|"statement"|"Owner Derrick together with the team headed by Chef Naz, who has a background in malay cuisine and trained in Italian cooking; came up with an array of modern european dishes with a local twist."
"1406"|"rhetoric"|"rhetoric"|"Alas, why they allocated such a little quantity to its outlet?"
"1407"|"statement"|"statement"|"This restaurant is located at the top level of suntec and gives a nice view to customers especially when they are dining and looking down to the 1st floor."
"1408"|"question"|"question"|"Dear Singapore, what do you have against dry napkins?"
"1409"|"statement"|"statement"|"And this is what makes Loo's such a delight."
"1410"|"statement"|"statement"|"Win-win all around (especially when you start thinking of about the carbs + fat + cheese + calories on the menu)."
"1411"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were very disappointed but made do with what we had."
"1412"|"question"|"question"|"Cant finish the awesome tarts and dont know what to do with them?"
"1413"|"statement"|"statement"|"If truly your food portions are dependent on the fluctuating costs of the ingredients, then I'd rather spend my money somewhere else- where they don't think that 6-7 mussels would matter and make them a loss."
"1414"|"statement"|"statement"|"Seriously despite the low rating, this is possibly the ONLY food delivery option if you find yourself hungry after midnight and I guess that's why they are still in high demand."
"1415"|"statement"|"statement"|"Considering the amount of choice around Orchard, I don't understand why there are so many customers."
"1416"|"statement"|"statement"|"Recommended by a close chef friend of mine who insisted I should give a try, I finally made my way down to Swee Choon after a night of partying and was left impressed."
"1417"|"statement"|"statement"|"As it was so last minute, we weren't sure where we would be eating so we decided to walk down Boat Quay and find something that would be to both our liking."
"1418"|"statement"|"statement"|"The whole concept is semi self service, so you order at a counter, you pick our your own bottle, and they bring it to your table when it's ready."
"1419"|"statement"|"statement"|"All of the items come with a photo which is nice for those who might not be familiar."
"1420"|"statement"|"statement"|"As most tables were under reservations, we were showed to a table by the entrance, which was a bit annoying as most people who walked past inclined to take a peek at what we were eating."
"1421"|"statement"|"statement"|"Let me know what you think!"
"1422"|"statement"|"statement"|"Pricing was steep ($8) but hey, you get what you pay for."
"1423"|"statement"|"statement"|"Spacious and authentic decor explains why even the locals like it here."
"1424"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just like other local dishes, there are different requirements to what makes a good bowl of fish soup in Singapore even to locals."
"1425"|"statement"|"statement"|"The baked goods weren't spectacular, but that's because we're spoiled with delicious California baked goods and cheap/fresh Taiwanese bakery bread when we travel."
"1426"|"statement"|"statement"|"Depending on what is your mood there is a place for you."
"1427"|"statement"|"statement"|"don't get me wrong i am fine with this, but tell me up front when i sit down that i have to pay cash and dont play dumb once i get my bill (which wasn't exactly cheap)."
"1428"|"statement"|"statement"|"They need to add some jam as a condiment for those who want it."
"1429"|"statement"|"statement"|"For S$5.50 you can get a big bowl of salad (from any of the 4 - 5 salad shops operating there) when the same bowl of greens can easily cost you 15 or more in the fancy cafes around telok ayer and raffles place."
"1430"|"statement"|"statement"|"But that's where the good stuff ends."
"1431"|"statement"|"statement"|"We started out an assortment of sashimi, namely golden-eyed snapper, medium fatty tuna, arc shell, and what looked like either Spanish or horse mackerel."
"1432"|"statement"|"statement"|"So for those who doesn't really eat spicy, this laksa should be good."
"1433"|"statement"|"statement"|"Very tasty, well cooked scallops on a bed of spinach with what I think was confit garlic."
"1434"|"statement"|"statement"|"We also ordered a taco but even now as I'm writing this review, I cant even remember what kind of taco we ordered."
"1435"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's what I like to assume is the best balance of carbs and veggies ;)  Admittedly, service was a bit spotty, but not enough to deter me from enjoying my experience."
"1436"|"statement"|"statement"|"The chicken itself was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, the rice full of oily flavor; all incredibly delicious when topped with thick soy sauce and chili."
"1437"|"statement"|"statement"|"Where everyone is treated as an equal,  and where the lines know no end."
"1438"|"statement"|"statement"|"L  In short, the place offers you a great evening, is centrally located, and is much bigger on the inside than what the facade suggests."
"1439"|"statement"|"statement"|"Steamed carrot cake was also a little too tough and bland for my preference - I really prefer it when the texture is softer with more flavour (I'm thinking of the one at Wah Lok@Carlton Hotel as an example)."
"1440"|"statement"|"statement"|"So for those of you who shun the sun, come at night!"
"1441"|"statement"|"statement"|"IMO the best in Singapore, where the noodles is very eggy and it's cooked like an al dente pasta."
"1442"|"statement"|"statement"|"Nothing super classy, which is a good change in singapore where a lot of good restaurants seem to have a classy/chic ambiance."
"1443"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Toastbox is like any other Toastbox and it has a good selection of egg tarts, probably targeting the office workers in the neighbourhood who pop by for tea."
"1444"|"statement"|"statement"|"In almost every way, this is exactly what Viva Mexico is."
"1445"|"statement"|"statement"|"Great place if you have no idea what to eat, they have everything!"
"1446"|"statement"|"statement"|"The hostess stand had an iPad where we checked in digitally and received texts regarding the status of our table."
"1447"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Fairmont Gold Floor incl the lounge is pretty nice, the offerings in the evening for cocktail and snack hour are of good quality and definitely in the upper range of what the chain hotels offer."
"1448"|"statement"|"statement"|"It has all been said before, only for those who have not been to Singapore, you cannot understand it until you have made your way to Singapore.. And in the world of chicken and rice and the lines that follow, as Yoda says, There is no try, only do."
"1449"|"statement"|"statement"|"Originated from Osaka, Japan, this place is famous for their kazan (volcanic) ramens, where their famed tonkotsu broth is poured onto the ramen on a stone bowl and cooked until the steam comes out (which according to them is volcanic eruption!)."
"1450"|"statement"|"statement"|"Final verdict: Mr You Tiao knows very well what works well with the beloved dough and is not afraid to whip it up and serve it!"
"1451"|"statement"|"statement"|"I did however only pay $80 because of the $100 voucher, which means I actually found it still a wee bit pricy for what it was worth."
"1452"|"statement"|"statement"|"The place wasn't full which was great, if you're looking for a place where you can have a conversation without shouting."
"1453"|"statement"|"statement"|"I like Coffee & Toast when I have a craving for a Singaporean breakfast."
"1454"|"statement"|"statement"|"I supposed this has become a tourist attraction and gone are the days where cheap and good can go hand in hand."
"1455"|"statement"|"statement"|"For one who do not like basil, it really tastes very good."
"1456"|"statement"|"statement"|"Will be back again when I crave a reuben!"
"1457"|"statement"|"statement"|"nah, i am having fun what "
"1458"|"statement"|"statement"|"Bangkok Jam is another concept by Creative Eateries, the same group who run Siam Kitchen, Sho-Teppan and Suki-ya."
"1459"|"statement"|"statement"|"It depends on what is available during that season really."
"1460"|"statement"|"statement"|"The whole place is as auhentic as it gets, and it serves what is undoubtedly the best briyani in Singapore."
"1461"|"statement"|"statement"|"One down side is that the prices can be pretty steep for what one may consider as an 'upmarket' bread talk (or a korean Tiong Bahru Bakery)."
"1462"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service was good but nothing outstanding, just what you would expect from such an establishment."
"1463"|"statement"|"statement"|"I wouldn't pair wines again, but I'd do that menu again no matter what was on it."
"1464"|"statement"|"statement"|"A bit run down a dirty as well, which I guess is part of the experience but don't expect a nice dining experience : the setting is definitely simple, especially in the tables in the back where roaches are never far."
"1465"|"statement"|"statement"|"It tastes very distinctly of fresh prawn here, compared to other places where it may taste more like fish or fish cake."
"1466"|"statement"|"statement"|"Ever since El Quesito Peque?ito bounced into our lives, El Queso Grande has been, shall we say, extra protective... Of his cheese...   After all, even a small baby who loves cheese sauce will someday grow into a small toddler with an ever larger appetite for cheese cubes, large and small..."
"1467"|"statement"|"statement"|"My wife had what she described as the best burger she has had in Singapore."
"1468"|"statement"|"statement"|"Well, it is a good snack, crispy when it first came."
"1469"|"statement"|"statement"|"So if you're someone like me who needs rice, it doesn't make sense to eat ala carte here."
"1470"|"statement"|"statement"|"the desserts here smacked of a kitchen that rather knows what it's doing - but which could use improvement."
"1471"|"statement"|"statement"|"Recalling what I had on my last two visits, I chose an array of sweet bread which tasted almost new to me."
"1472"|"statement"|"statement"|"HOWEVER, it seems as though many others have realised this because when I walked past the store on a friday night, the queue was CRAZY and stretched all the way out of the mall into the road leading up to the carpark (a very hot and smelly wait)."
"1473"|"statement"|"statement"|"I waited for my food but when it came it was worth the wait; it is cooked fresh and the lamb tikka was so tasty."
"1474"|"statement"|"statement"|"The service was good, with constant topping up of water and removing of plates when done."
"1475"|"statement"|"statement"|"So that's what we did ~  Our drinks came first."
"1476"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've been dining here for years when I'm lazy to dress up to eat elsewhere or when I just don't feel like spending a lot on food."
"1477"|"statement"|"statement"|"Excited to go back when I wasn't sweating and smelly, Jerry decided to join me."
"1478"|"statement"|"statement"|"The desserts here looks awesome too.. and I don't know if anyone knows this but there's a tunnel that goes straight to where One Fullerton."
"1479"|"statement"|"statement"|"The lack of seating to me is a problem as we pay a premium for coffees and hot chocolates and I do it when I want to chill and have a chat/crowd watch."
"1480"|"statement"|"statement"|"A short walk from Boon Keng MRT Station, this food centre is very popular among local residents and people who work at the nearby industrial area and offices."
"1481"|"statement"|"statement"|"The brussel sprouts here don't taste as bitter or have as much of brussel sprout taste as what you would get in California."
"1482"|"statement"|"statement"|"The worse part was when our server took the lid off the pot of mussels we ordered."
"1483"|"statement"|"statement"|"The short of it is: exceptional ingredients, skilfully prepared, by a chef who has a great palate."
"1484"|"statement"|"statement"|"Cooking is sometimes a long process and when you have 3 kinds of it...you'll have to cut corners to make a profit."
"1485"|"statement"|"statement"|"As a result, the front of the restaurant where the reception counter is, gets rather crowded with people milling around."
"1486"|"statement"|"statement"|"Only real shocker when the bill came was that the focaccia (pizza bianca) cost $12.80."
"1487"|"statement"|"statement"|"Our favorite east coast eatery introduced by a buddy who bailed for vietnam!"
"1488"|"statement"|"statement"|"One wonders why this doesn't feature in more minced pork noodles sold everywhere because it makes such a good combination!"
"1489"|"statement"|"statement"|"A must try for anyone who like real bbq!"
"1490"|"statement"|"statement"|"After sitting at a seat close to the fountain where the sun was beating down on me, I felt rather hot and decided to get something to cool myself down."
"1491"|"statement"|"statement"|"But that's little consolidation when half of what's being brought isn't the food you ordered."
"1492"|"statement"|"statement"|"In my opinion what sets their Xiao Long Bao apart is the soup filling, which has a better, tastier flavour."
"1493"|"statement"|"statement"|"+ They were out of Char Siew when we ordered around 6:30pm, so we ordered the soya chicken rice and noodle."
"1494"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just when you think Singapore does not have that much new to offer it surprises you."
"1495"|"statement"|"statement"|"Three times bigger than the original outlet, what this means is that you can finally sit down and enjoy your croissants and kougin amans in peace without having people bump into you or trying to yell over the din."
"1496"|"statement"|"statement"|"While the dishes may change each day due to the availability of produce in the market, the restaurant should offer a printed menu at least after dining so that I can remember what I had and which one of the eight philosophies it was suppose to invoke."
"1497"|"statement"|"statement"|"The following was what we had:  - Crackers were served the moment we sat down: It resembled the crackers they put in the prosperity Yu Sheng, except this was crunchier and more addictive."
"1498"|"rhetoric"|"rhetoric"|"You can get Ippudo originals here too, but why not try something different?"
"1499"|"statement"|"statement"|"At the end of eating her meal, the guy who tricked my wife, tells us the bill is $130 Singapore dollars!!"
"1500"|"statement"|"statement"|"They also didn't bother to explain what fish was on the sushi, so I can't tell you much about it."
"1501"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were under the impression that for 22 SGD we would be able to split the pineapple rice between all four of us but this was not the case, so food price at this restaurant could be considered expensive for what it is ($$$)."
"1502"|"statement"|"statement"|"You'll need to do a bit of detective work to find exactly where the nondescript entrance to this place is."
"1503"|"statement"|"statement"|"For a fine dining establishment, I expected top notch service such as napkin placement when you are seated, napkin folded when you leave your seat, and a better explanation of each dish."
"1504"|"statement"|"statement"|"We use their iPad to place our orders and had a personal server who most wait on us."
"1505"|"statement"|"statement"|"Also, they didn't serve what we felt are the traditional garnishes: bean sprouts, basil, and lime."
"1506"|"statement"|"statement"|"But when we wanted to add some dessert, we were told that we can no longer use another groupon, because she has already scanned."
"1507"|"statement"|"statement"|"I ordered the Truffle Ramen (my heart ached a bit when I saw that it was $38 before tax), then looked through the rest of their offerings."
"1508"|"statement"|"statement"|"Per Muji's recommendation, be sure to grab the seat first and place a metal table tent on it reserving it to guarantee your spot when you get out of the line."
"1509"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Roasted Pork Collar The very hot pot came to us with two other sides and you will go WOW when the lid is opened."
"1510"|"statement"|"statement"|"There are places where you go just for the food or just for the atmosphere, or both."
"1511"|"statement"|"statement"|"Three of us arrived at 3pm when high tea starts and were told they were already out of the Oriental Tea menu, meaning no dim sum appetizer."
"1512"|"statement"|"statement"|"We ate at the sushi bar where you place your order by grabbing the menus, a pencil and paper and simply write down what you want."
"1513"|"statement"|"statement"|"I attended a work related event here 2 month's ago, which means this is on the sell side radar/price point (see my review of Lucho Luca for what this entails)."
"1514"|"question"|"question"|"We took the buffet because it made sense to pay $25 to try a few flavors since even though he's half Korean, we both had no idea what Yamyung (?)"
"1515"|"statement"|"statement"|"I must spend way to much time looking at Google Maps because when I discovered this place I knew that I had to check it out (especially being such a book nerd)."
"1516"|"statement"|"statement"|"Yes, it does get crowded, so get there when it opens."
"1517"|"statement"|"statement"|"and an indian meal just isn't complete without a curry or daal, especially when you have delicious naan to sop it up with."
"1518"|"statement"|"statement"|"The taste was amazing, where the crepe is still a bit warm and the ice cream is still cold."
"1519"|"statement"|"statement"|"$32  Rhubard with ginger caramel, lingonberry ice cream & roasted white chocolate - now this is mind blowing and this is coming from a person who doesn't really like desserts in general."
"1520"|"statement"|"statement"|"Be forewarned, there is no where nearby to sit."
"1521"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was bland  Shrimp cooked where no flavor Anyway you can give it a try but I'm not sure if I will be back"
"1522"|"question"|"question"|"what is the opening hours? "
"1523"|"statement"|"statement"|"Overall a nice place in a nice area, but couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed when leaving."
"1524"|"statement"|"statement"|"Overall it's good  The only downside is that I was gives a two beds room where I have requested for a kingbed."
"1525"|"question"|"question"|"So where did things go downhill?"
"1526"|"question"|"question"|"can i quit my job? "
"1527"|"statement"|"statement"|"Staff here were very friendly when we were there, and we were lucky to have visited the cafe at a not so busy hours that we could get in straight away without any wait."
"1528"|"statement"|"statement"|"My main gripe and why I don't come here very often is that their portions are minuscule, even if you pony up for the elephant size meal (which I think is $12 to start and then additional for toppings)."
"1529"|"statement"|"statement"|"Great  house beer particularly like the pale lager and they do have decent choice for those who are not into beer be it wine or spirits, had asked for a JD coke one of those days when I didn't feel like another beer and it was really well mixed, don't know what they did but the proportions just seemed right!"
"1530"|"statement"|"statement"|"Remember to get a table by the window when you dines at the restaurant."
"1531"|"statement"|"statement"|"I enjoyed my experience here very much, they didn't chase me out of the place when I decided to read a book there."
"1532"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is probably the best place along Killiney Road to get a beer - I'm talking about $5 for a glass of house wine, a bottle of cider, or beer (can't remember which they served), and the d?cor is tasteful and classy, the waiters are well-dressed and attentive and offer you water even if you didn't ask for it, and the owner even 'closed-one-eye' when I used one of their sockets to power up my phone."
"1533"|"statement"|"statement"|"might give them a second chance but maybe in a while when they get things together."
"1534"|"statement"|"statement"|"But, why not, I'll say it again, the Best Calamari dish in Singapore."
"1535"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure why it's so expensive here."
"1536"|"statement"|"statement"|"No more seat outside also when I went there."
"1537"|"statement"|"statement"|"I couldn't describe what I had, because every drink is slightly different, but the Sophie/Sophia is really amazing."
"1538"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not to mention the inconsistent position taken when I first arrived at the restaurant."
"1539"|"statement"|"statement"|"Most of the staff working here are very polite and will help you look for what you need without any fuss."
"1540"|"statement"|"statement"|"The coffee, however, is where it shines."
"1541"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just mark on the paper what dim-sum you would like."
"1542"|"statement"|"statement"|"This less than a year old Cafe is founded by Shaun Gian who happened to serve us during our visit."
"1543"|"statement"|"statement"|"Eating out is difficult for me in general, but eating at a buffet is particularly stressful as I have to inquire about ingredients of so many different dishes and it can be challenging to find someone who can really assure me of the food safety."
"1544"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"why did i even ask you? "
"1545"|"statement"|"statement"|"Some times when the weather is too hot, I don't like to eat at the People's Park Hawker centre as it can be quite stuffy and humid."
"1546"|"statement"|"statement"|"Beggars can't be choosers when looking for tacos in Singapore, so see you there on Taco Tuesday."
"1547"|"question"|"question"|"Where it falls when compared to NY/New Haven pizza is that the sauce is a little off (a tad too sweet?)"
"1548"|"statement"|"statement"|"Go when you are feeling leisurely and definitely not starved and on an empty stomach!"
"1549"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had the boat version since I had no idea what that included and wanted to try something new."
"1550"|"statement"|"statement"|"I recommend you to come here not just for the food but to see what true service is all about (especially when Karlson is on shift)."
"1551"|"statement"|"statement"|"In fact my friends all made faces when they tried and said it was too much."
"1552"|"statement"|"statement"|"Exactly what a good manager should be doing going table to table speaking with guests, she was great."
"1553"|"statement"|"statement"|"While I find the chilli and dark soy sauce here pretty average, the ginger is very nice and adds an even deeper dimension when eaten with the rice."
"1554"|"statement"|"statement"|"Was expecting an out-of-this-world experience especially with the traditional shrimp dumplings,  xiao long baos, egg tarts (which are a must have at every dim sum for me) and chee cheong fun, but what surprised me most was their egg fried rice and fish porridge which blew me away."
"1555"|"statement"|"statement"|"Another issue with the oysters was, for some reason, when he asked if we were going to share and we said yes, the server doubled our order."
"1556"|"statement"|"statement"|"Blended with white chocolate, the bread has a tinge of milky sweetness, which was slightly different from the taste when I had it in Japan."
"1557"|"statement"|"statement"|"And it's not like they suffer from lack of customers on weekends - the place was full when I was there at around 4 pm on Saturday."
"1558"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was empty and she even drank all the soup when I went and get us a barley drink!"
"1559"|"statement"|"statement"|"I expected bland, tasteless food, like some cafes where the cooks are really not competent."
"1560"|"statement"|"statement"|"There are people who pick the pork ribs and prawn option."
"1561"|"statement"|"statement"|"The restaurant even gave me superior treatment when I was pregnant/we had our baby and immediately gave us seats or moved us to a wider table."
"1562"|"statement"|"statement"|"Let me update this review when I have more things to write about."
"1563"|"question"|"rhetoric"|"What do you do when you can't stop a friend from endlessly raving about a place?"
"1564"|"statement"|"statement"|"Well, not this place, given the generosity of the aunties who capably ply the storefront."
"1565"|"statement"|"statement"|"People don't stop when they're done with the noodles, they finish their broth - that's always a good sign."
"1566"|"question"|"question"|"The original version is only $2.50, and who sells at this price now?"
"1567"|"statement"|"statement"|"The ambience is pretty loud and gets even louder when the house band starts playing after 10pm, not a good place for a quiet date but perfect for pigging out with friends!"
"1568"|"statement"|"statement"|"Eating in Tolido's is a great opportunity for people who love breakfast and pastas."
"1569"|"statement"|"statement"|"Customers who ordered this dish would need to thoroughly mix the beef tartare with the truffle egg yolk and cilantro dust."
"1570"|"statement"|"statement"|"Unfortunately the indoor, air-conditioned area is small so you may have to sit outside when it is busy."
"1571"|"statement"|"statement"|"Soy Sauce Chicken or See Yao Gai made regular appearances at our family dinner table when I was growing up."
"1572"|"statement"|"statement"|"So looked around an found Imakatsu which was not exactly what I was looking for, but close enough."
"1573"|"statement"|"statement"|"But what stood out amongst these already awesome choices was its tofu cheesecake."
"1574"|"statement"|"statement"|"Bars, restaurants and facilities -- I'm really not sure where to start with this."
"1575"|"statement"|"statement"|"The lack of space and close proximity to offices in Suntec City means that there's always a crunch when it comes to peak periods so be prepared to share a table, or get there early so you don't have to queue in the blazing hot sun."
"1576"|"statement"|"statement"|"Look at Erich's Wuertstelstand, where he made a joke The last sausage kiosk before the equator and bingo!"
"1577"|"statement"|"statement"|"We had our first taste of their wonderful giant pizzas at the Greenwood outlet and when they started to branch out to the various parts of Singapore."
"1578"|"statement"|"statement"|"Look through the menu and write down on the paper what you would like, and call for a waitress."
"1579"|"statement"|"statement"|"On the one hand it's kinda cool, like a localized burrito, on the other hand, it's not what I thought I was going to buy for lunch."
"1580"|"statement"|"statement"|"Well... you get EXACTLY what you pay for -  you can order a whole steak... with a side of that delicious japanese rice with egg or you can spend 35 -40ish with cubed wagyu with rice and an egg in a claypot."
"1581"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had never had one before so dont know what to compare it to."
"1582"|"statement"|"statement"|"the latter had a spoon of fig compote that I thought was a little too similar in style to the creamy ice - it really would have benefited from something tarter, or more texturally different, but I'm quibbling on what was still a decent sweet."
"1583"|"statement"|"statement"|"The downside of waiting till you are seated is when most of your party have not arrive."
"1584"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was impressed that they were able to provide us with the electrical outlet converter when I made the request."
"1585"|"question"|"question"|"But who really cares?"
"1586"|"statement"|"statement"|"27$ for two persons, what a bargain!"
"1587"|"statement"|"statement"|"Now I've got to start planning when I'm going back."
"1588"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you know what I mean."
"1589"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was really excited about my burger prospects when I placed my takeaway order and was drooling watching someone eat their burger and fries while I waited for mine to be done."
"1590"|"statement"|"statement"|"Special thanks to the cabbie who dropped this knowledge on me and my colleague as we took a cab from the office to Napoleon!"
"1591"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was clearly an indian restaurant who catered to the western market (as evident in their inflated pricing)."
"1592"|"statement"|"statement"|"Accordingly, it pleases J who is won over by its fresh texture and natural taste, less obscuring."
"1593"|"statement"|"statement"|"Good food at a very reasonable price what more can you ask for.It can get quite congested and finding a seat can be a challenge but if you can get past that then the end result will be sumptuous.There is a lot of variety there from Singaporean Chicken Rice to Chinese to Desert and the reasonable does not sacrifice quality so definitely try it out if you can."
"1594"|"statement"|"statement"|"After checking into my hotel, checked out Yelp to see what restaurants in the area may be appealing."
"1595"|"statement"|"statement"|"Eating crab can be quite messy and that is why I chose a nice sit down restaurant with white tablecloths."
"1596"|"statement"|"statement"|"The rice could be better but is good enough for me especially when you put everything together in one mouthful."
"1597"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just don't get a shock when you find yourself paying $7 and upwards for a dish."
"1598"|"statement"|"statement"|"Also, I understand that this is a fast food establishment, but that doesn't mean yelling at your customer when they ask if credit cards are accepted is warranted."
"1599"|"statement"|"statement"|"I asked the waiter about seeing what they can do to find out if I can watch the football game later."
"1600"|"statement"|"statement"|"Draws a touristy crowd who is willing to pay $7-$12 per meal."
"1601"|"statement"|"statement"|"For members they have sofas and rectangle tables to kick back and relax on, but if your not there are plenty of standing tables near the entrance where you can enjoy your favorite drink, view and music."
"1602"|"statement"|"statement"|"I came expecting little and walked away thinking when else I can find an excuse to come back."
"1603"|"statement"|"statement"|"I expected this food court to be jaw-droppingly expensive when I first visited, but it's actually not so bad."
"1604"|"statement"|"statement"|"whereas the skin on tian tian is good enough to eat on it's own and gets even better when eaten with the meat, the skin here definitely adds to the meat flavor and texture but can not stand on its own."
"1605"|"question"|"question"|"got any places serve chips a not? "
"1606"|"statement"|"statement"|"And what really put a damper on the experience is how they serve you peanuts and walk around pouring you green tea like it's complimentary, and then it shows up on your bill!"
"1607"|"statement"|"statement"|"It would be great if the iPads used to place orders could have an English version of the menu - to help tourists and those of us who are Mandarin-challenged!"
"1608"|"question"|"question"|"With all the chicken rice stalls and restaurants popping up, with one receiving a Bib Gourmand from Singapore's Michelin guide, what differentiates Loy Kee from the rest of the pack?"
"1609"|"question"|"question"|"I have no doubt that my nostalgia unfairly colors my musings about this dish, but aren't all our food adventures just an extension of where we've been and what we've done and with whom?"
"1610"|"statement"|"statement"|"I always get the dry noodles with pork ribs - I feel the noodles don't get as soggy and soup-laden (not that it's a bad thing), and I get to drink the soup separately, apart from the chili and what nots that find their way into the bowl."
"1611"|"statement"|"statement"|"I will likely go back when I want some aburi foie gras sushi or uni in chirashi."
"1612"|"statement"|"statement"|"I found it slightly salty but the friend found it ok.   What I don't like is that they charge $5 for green tea though."
"1613"|"statement"|"statement"|"I guess that's what makes this restaurant a truly AUTHENTIC FIND!"
"1614"|"statement"|"statement"|"Though the cafe has ample seating and is rather quiet on weekdays, do note the lunch hours/afternoon hours where many from the nearby office buildings crowd the place-it might be a little too noisy then!"
"1615"|"statement"|"statement"|"It is best if you visit on a friday or saturday where they open till late!"
"1616"|"statement"|"statement"|"but they really need to get their act together when it comes to organizing a sports event like the superbowl!"
"1617"|"statement"|"statement"|"My dad, who hates chicken, liked it!"
"1618"|"statement"|"statement"|"Right atop People's Park Complex - where your mum would shop for tour packages at a travel agency, do cheap manicure, or change money."
"1619"|"statement"|"statement"|"Oh and they only take cash... coming from cashless NZ where you pay card for a 50cent transaction... this is tough for me to remember!"
"1620"|"statement"|"statement"|"But what really bought me over was the warm rice each sushi was served with."
"1621"|"statement"|"statement"|"After minutes of looking over the menu, we decided to get a mix of kebabs, hummus and bread and K?nefe (see description of what this dish entails through Jeannie's review)."
"1622"|"statement"|"statement"|"The lobby lounge at Conrad doesn't exactly come to mind when you think of Hotel food outlets that specialize in something e.g."
"1623"|"statement"|"statement"|"There were at least three other Japanese families dining there, so I'm assuming I'm not the only one who feel this way."
"1624"|"statement"|"statement"|"This was one of my favourite haunts for lunch when I worked in the area for half a year."
"1625"|"statement"|"statement"|"And if this is achieved, I can see no reason why UsQuBa will give other restaurants within its vicinity a run of their money."
"1626"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Aburi Kaisen Chirashi Don, which in my view, is the STAR dish of this restaurant, is not available at the original location, from what I remember."
"1627"|"question"|"question"|"First & foremost, I do not know where one yelper really went, this restaurant does not has a seating on a tarmac (what?"
"1628"|"statement"|"statement"|"The soup tasted nothing like what a kimchi soup should be."
"1629"|"statement"|"statement"|"Will definitely return when I visit Singapore again."
"1630"|"statement"|"statement"|"Of course i had to sample them before i can decide on what to buy home!"
"1631"|"statement"|"statement"|"It makes a good bite-sized if variety is what you are looking for."
"1632"|"statement"|"statement"|"One day we had lunch in the premises, and I was hoping it would be better when we got it fresh from the kitchen."
"1633"|"statement"|"statement"|"It does get a little squeezy when it gets crowded but when I was there, I was surrounded by quite a few Japaanese people and it was a bit of a fun for me to pretend I was away on holiday."
"1634"|"statement"|"statement"|"Their truffle fries are the perfect starters, and I suggest you devour them as soon as they're served, as that's when they taste the best!"
"1635"|"statement"|"statement"|"The service was quite good although a little in your face when clearing food if I am to be picky."
"1636"|"statement"|"statement"|"I would definitely be back when in need of a place to chill with some friends!"
"1637"|"statement"|"statement"|"When I first read about this restaurant on a friend's facebook post, I couldn't believe what I read."
"1638"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you have made this far reading this review, I really hope that if you go there you really know what you are wasting your money, time and calories on."
"1639"|"statement"|"statement"|"The first time I stepped into Oriole was way back when 313 Somerset was still under construction and hasn't opened yet, you have to walk through the Pan Pacific Serviced Suites to get to it and I thought I found the best hidden gem ever...it used to be really quiet, peaceful with superb coffee to boot!"
"1640"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Japanese eggplant was sliced into rounds was plain on its own naturally but a perfect match when eaten with the pasta."
"1641"|"statement"|"statement"|"Though the manager may get a little flustered trying to arrange tables while ensuring diners are still well served, he's a real sweetheart who make sure all customers are happy."
"1642"|"statement"|"statement"|"Was quick in serving water when asked too."
"1643"|"statement"|"statement"|"I can't taste what is different in between foie gras, black truffle or crab roe."
"1644"|"statement"|"statement"|"A classic cheesesteak spot would typically just offer a cheesesteak, and let the customer specify what they wanted beyond cheese and steak."
"1645"|"question"|"question"|"Of course we had contests, and these are the champions... but who crowned them?"
"1646"|"statement"|"statement"|"Services are great as usual and this is one of the places you should bring guests where aft meal you can stroll along flower dome."
"1647"|"statement"|"statement"|"The dressing was the real star, and although when you look at the amount of food you are getting, you start to panic, but you'll be full."
"1648"|"statement"|"statement"|"We usually come here for the happy hour where martinis go for a song (relatively) and there's free flow of steak sandwiches to go around."
"1649"|"statement"|"statement"|"You can tell they make their own sauces (or at least that's what it tastes like), not something out of the bottle."
"1650"|"statement"|"statement"|"Fully staffed, but I still had to air traffic control someone over when I wanted something."
"1651"|"statement"|"statement"|"Located on the outside of Sim Lim square facing across Rochor Road at the first level, this little Noodle cafe is worth trying when you want to take a break from braving the hard sell shenanigans at Sim Lim Square."
"1652"|"statement"|"statement"|"One server asked me if I didn't like the food because my plate was clean and when I said that I was eating and a cockroach crawled onto my plate, he laughed."
"1653"|"statement"|"statement"|"Damnit, people, that's why it's dessert."
"1654"|"statement"|"statement"|"I came here a while ago so I know this definitely needs a revisit and a review but all I can say is from past experience I highly recommend this place because, it just wasn't what I expected."
"1655"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was somewhat surprised that it was about 100.00 per person and I thought it to be steep for what you get."
"1656"|"statement"|"statement"|"This place is the holiest of holy sites in Singapore when it comes to seafood."
"1657"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm a fan of Chef Benny and what he does, since his first outlet at Eastpoint Mall."
"1658"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is where people who cannot tahan the queues for the Japanese restaurants in The Central mall end up."
"1659"|"statement"|"statement"|"We went on to recommend it to friends who stayed in Singapore later."
"1660"|"statement"|"statement"|"It used to be even more so when the servers were mostly senior aunties and uncles, but lately there are more young foreign servers who are not exactly fluent in English, so remember to speak slowly and get them to confirm your orders."
"1661"|"statement"|"statement"|"Perhaps because of the crowd, Blu Jazz can sometimes feel fake and off-putting, but hey, when the crowd is right, Blu Jazz can be pretty awesome."
"1662"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think this place is far from a 'cool southern diner' which is what they market themselves to be - save your money and go to MeatSmith!"
"1663"|"statement"|"statement"|"Others had a slightly dry texture even when rehydrated in the soup."
"1664"|"statement"|"statement"|"If that offended anyone (either comparing the Brits to Germans or vice versa) I apologize, but the point is, you can sell $8 sausages to people who are half drunk, but you won't get away with it at lunchtime."
"1665"|"statement"|"statement"|"To all those who claim Raffles Hotel's is good, you haven't tried this."
"1666"|"statement"|"statement"|"I like to come on weekends, when parking is less of a pain."
"1667"|"statement"|"statement"|"The range of drinks, wines and saki is very expensive so be prepared if that's what you're in the mood for."
"1668"|"statement"|"statement"|"The worst was when, toward the end of our meal, they seated two girls who were wearing denim shorts and flip flops."
"1669"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm not quite certain where the latest Krazy Kreative Kool Korean Fried Chicken recipes are thought up, but I like to imagine that there's a secret lab in Korea somewhere, maybe on a secret island, stocked with K-Pop stars in bedazzled lab coats, surrounded by test tubes, chicken, all sorts of cooking equipment and copious amounts of watermelon soju..."
"1670"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you don't think so, then you need to read about what dum biryani really is."
"1671"|"statement"|"statement"|"Trust me, you would appreciate that when it is 40 C + with humidity!"
"1672"|"statement"|"statement"|"I ordered a spicy mos burger and my initial thought when I got it was that it was very sloppy like a sloppy joe, but when I bit into it I was surprised that it was actually pretty good!"
"1673"|"statement"|"statement"|"Located right in the botanical gardens in the middle of the city, this place is a lush, tropical oasis where one can seek respite from the heat and get relax in FFT."
"1674"|"statement"|"statement"|"The food was great but the price seemed a bit too much for what was offered."
"1675"|"statement"|"statement"|"The pasta dishes are what you could expect from a place like this but nothing spectacular."
"1676"|"statement"|"statement"|"The staff are all quite young, perhaps that's why they're all bustling very busily to little effect."
"1677"|"statement"|"statement"|"Thus the price of a popular beer goes up, while the least popular beers go down (which is probably why they don't have VB on tap)."
"1678"|"statement"|"statement"|"The popping yoghurt jelly was quite a joy as well, and they were very very generous with their helping of it, when I usually scrap to get enough at other places."
"1679"|"statement"|"statement"|"For me, Yazawa still sets the standard when it comes to yakiniku of this price range, but not to say that Gyuu isn't good."
"1680"|"statement"|"statement"|"Compared to the reviews I was hoping for better maybe it was an off day but I think food should be a good temperature of warmth when given if it supposed to be hot food."
"1681"|"statement"|"statement"|"The waiter asked what soups we wanted and we decided to try sukiyaki and shabu shabu."
"1682"|"statement"|"statement"|"Seriously, you want to enjoy the food you eat, and it's hard to do that when the people serving you lie and cheat directly to your face."
"1683"|"statement"|"statement"|"I prefer popping by around 3pm in the afternoon for a tea time snack - where I immediately go for the set of 8 Xiao Long Baos that all come in different flavours."
"1684"|"statement"|"statement"|"It comes with this delightfully soft-cooked egg that has an oozing yolk when you pierce it."
"1685"|"statement"|"statement"|"By keeping to what they do best, it maintains the standard."
"1686"|"statement"|"statement"|"That's when one of my team suggested to go to the study as she had been there and had some glowing reviews about the food."
"1687"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was thus fairly upset on my latest visit when I found out that they had taken it off their menu."
"1688"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even my dining partner who is a wuss with spicy food cannot stop herself scraping the sauce up with the remaining crackers!"
"1689"|"statement"|"statement"|"Understandably, perhaps their more traditional dishes are where their strengths lie, I ordered the $6 chicken pad Thai and $6 crab fried rice."
"1690"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think what we have here in Singapore are some of the most beautiful - and I've been to many around the world."
"1691"|"statement"|"statement"|"Especially when you are starving, waiting time can get u agitated."
"1692"|"statement"|"statement"|"Boon Tong Kee and Tian Tian tops my list as the two places to go to when I want the best Hainanese Chicken Rice in Singapore."
"1693"|"statement"|"statement"|"They also refill your soup for free as many times as you need, (at least 3 times, which is what they did for me), so you will undoubtedly walk away very warm and satisfied."
"1694"|"statement"|"statement"|"The staff never explained why our order was delayed, never apologized... then never even spoke to us other than to nod and then dash off."
"1695"|"statement"|"statement"|"I went in when they were having a special, but If I would have went in any other day, a bowl of ramen would have cost a minimum of $11."
"1696"|"statement"|"statement"|"i knew where she was going and quickly interjected,and a main course."
"1697"|"statement"|"statement"|"A definite must try when coming to Singapore!!!"
"1698"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure about the staffs knowledge though as I was asking a bit about the roast dates and they were not sure (always a bit hesitant when too much is on offer in a location that does not seem super busy as it may then be old) but appears there is mainly one person in charge of the coffee so perhaps she knows."
"1699"|"statement"|"statement"|"Lucky me that the queue wasn't too long when I reached here."
"1700"|"statement"|"statement"|"I began with a forgettable cheese puff but things improved when my heirloom tomato salad came."
"1701"|"statement"|"statement"|"as I cooked my organic sausages from Ryan's when he said, I brought bagels."
"1702"|"statement"|"statement"|"It also has a private dining room in a basement area - that's where I had the chance to try out lots of their food!"
"1703"|"statement"|"statement"|"My friend and I asked for water to be served after ordering and when the server came with water, he came back with only 1 glass of water when there were 2 of us."
"1704"|"rhetoric"|"rhetoric"|"But my acid test is always - if I can make it cheaper and better at home, then why bother?"
"1705"|"statement"|"statement"|"1/2 way thru they show me a black & white sheet outlining all of these different designs (remember that when I asked they seemed clueless about design offerings) including the chevron and the $30 (in USD) up charge!!!"
"1706"|"statement"|"statement"|"As a Japanese who just relocated to Singapore, I would say this ramen place serves something very similar to what I would expect in Tokyo."
"1707"|"statement"|"statement"|"i was thrilled when they opened a branch here."
"1708"|"statement"|"statement"|"Only happy when you are opening up your wallet."
"1709"|"statement"|"statement"|"The tarts are super delicious when they are fresh out of the oven."
"1710"|"statement"|"statement"|"Today I got seated right beside the tank where the restaurant keep their live seafood, I end up feel like 1 am one of the exhibit in the aquarium as lots kids will come with their parents to look at those fish or lobster."
"1711"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure if it's just what the taste is like, or because I didn't add milk / sugar."
"1712"|"statement"|"statement"|"This just might be my new go-to when I'm craving sit-down Mexican."
"1713"|"statement"|"statement"|"Neighborhood restaurant close to where my sister-in-law lives."
"1714"|"statement"|"statement"|"For those of you who like cheap sushi like sushi express and nihon mura but are sick of the selections that they have, you can try Itacho Sushi."
"1715"|"statement"|"statement"|"1 MINUTE later when I arrived at the front of the restaurant there was more than 20 people in the queue."
"1716"|"statement"|"statement"|"I took what Mary had left, which was biscuits with meat, and chicken on toast."
"1717"|"statement"|"statement"|"ENTER...my fine lady, who is so sweet in every possible manner and always ever thoughtful."
"1718"|"statement"|"statement"|"their braised beef brisket and tendon is also what i would come here for."
"1719"|"statement"|"statement"|"Looking forward to the day when I go back to Singapore to eat this ramen again!!"
"1720"|"statement"|"statement"|"I really liked how comfortable it felt to sit in the lounge area with its banquettes and cool rocking chairs (nice touch)   We ordered 1 appetizer, 2 mains & 2 desserts, most of which were delicious (don't order the Grilled whole lobster, way too expensive for what we got!"
"1721"|"question"|"question"|"But then again, in a country where $22-28 cocktail has become a norm, i guess this is the price to pay for glam-ed up street food?"
"1722"|"statement"|"statement"|"The place is quite airy, even when seated inside, thanks to its high ceiling and plentiful fans around."
"1723"|"statement"|"statement"|"(Or you can be like my cousin and I who insisted to have it on our lap instead)."
"1724"|"statement"|"statement"|"The chairs are really flimsy such that if you seat you would not know when it will break."
"1725"|"statement"|"statement"|"Asparagus, topped with a 65 degree poached egg, shaved black truffles, served with what tasted like a Hollandaise espuma."
"1726"|"statement"|"statement"|"You hand them your card when you order and they either hand you the food or tell you how long the wait will be."
"1727"|"statement"|"statement"|":)  Make sure you call and make a booking beforehand, as this place is very popular and the tables are always filled when I come in the evenings for dinner."
"1728"|"question"|"question"|"It's much of a straight cut and they are as deeply fried as the ones you have in MacD's (: I guess this is what they call a healthier choice...?"
"1729"|"statement"|"statement"|"There were 5 of us who wanted to go on our mission to devour a duck."
"1730"|"statement"|"statement"|"I may not manage to save enough room for dessert, but I have enjoyed them when I did plan ahead."
"1731"|"statement"|"statement"|"Banh mi is an amazing sandwich... Now I have had my fair share of sandwiches and growing up in New Zealand I have eaten them from breakfast to dinner   But when you have bahn mi, you get to taste a lot more than just mayo and pickles."
"1732"|"statement"|"statement"|"Olive Vine, a cheap and good place to dine in when you're on a budget."
"1733"|"question"|"question"|"OK, who has time to review?"
"1734"|"statement"|"statement"|"And I don't even say if you want a nice fancy Mexican dinner, because the music was too loud both from the restaurant itself and the Esplanade concert hall on the other end of the bay (we could feel the bass from where we were)."
"1735"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure why chicken rice isn't on their (rather extensive) menu, but that's the dish to get."
"1736"|"statement"|"statement"|"So when the option of The Naked Finn failed me for dinner (they only serve the rolls during lunch), i headed to Loh Lik Peng's The Market Grill."
"1737"|"statement"|"statement"|"You also get 10% off the menu when you check out before 10.30pm, which was a pretty good way to clear off most of the crowd before they close at 11pm."
"1738"|"statement"|"statement"|"So I went up to the counter where I learnt that yes, this is where I had to order."
"1739"|"statement"|"statement"|"Overall the experience was well below what you would expect at a higher end place and of course there is no view from inside the restaurant (where there is minimal though insufficient A/C)."
"1740"|"statement"|"statement"|"But it does tick all the other boxes when it comes to good chicken rice."
"1741"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm a big big waffle fan so I have high standards when it comes to waffles."
"1742"|"statement"|"statement"|"Depending on what matters to you but Timbre is a once-in-a-while place for me but would never replace my home pub."
"1743"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you're sitting at a booth, you can even watch people in other restaurants from other levels having food and what not."
"1744"|"statement"|"statement"|"I ordered a tea milk shake when I was at MBS (the Asian tea flavour) - which was so satisfying - wasn't too thick nor too sweet - and you could sense good tea in there with all that milk and sugar!"
"1745"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"Say the words, I ate at a hotel buffet when I was in Asia to Anthony Bourdain, and what is he apt to do?"
"1746"|"statement"|"statement"|"Our occasion was an extended work luncheon where we got to sample most of the beer and menu offerings."

"1748"|"statement"|"statement"|"During summer or even late spring, it is common for ramen-ya in Japan to churn out cold noodles in a bid to draw customers who are sweating profusely under hot temperatures of 36-37 degrees."
"1749"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's the only place I know in the heart of the business district where you can get great local food past 9pm."
"1750"|"question"|"question"|"And when did they start offering a spicy and original option?"

"1754"|"statement"|"statement"|"To be honest, everything BUT the food was good when we ate there this past weekend."
"1755"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'd read somewhere that the kebabs at this place were pretty good, so I made note to visit, and when I arrived I realised they served Iranian style kebabs."
"1756"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure what to feel about this combination as it is pretty new to us too."
"1757"|"statement"|"statement"|"Although the old outlet in Orchard was dated, it had this '90s American feel and pictures of the original Tony Roma's that really communicated what the brand was all about."
"1758"|"statement"|"statement"|"Back when Whampoa Makan Centre was just known as Whampoa Hawker Centre, Singapore Fried Hokkien Mee was already a popular stall that occupied the corner stall of the middle block in the hawker centre."
"1759"|"statement"|"statement"|"the salmon roe atop crispy fish skin was more in line with what I expected from this place - the best way to eat this is to smear the eggs evenly atop the surface, so you get a bit of salty fishiness in each bite - pretty delicious."
"1760"|"question"|"question"|"(If i didn;t have my own bottle of water i probably would have choke, thou i must say its illogical that the water for 3 people came after the tea i ordered, what happened was a mix of chaos  and lack of a proper system) I witness some other table's order missing a sausage and stuff (food processing wise i would say they really lack organisation, i mean they asked if we wanted our cake with the food (again what kinda question is this??)"
"1761"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even the waiter that came to help him had absolutely no idea of what drinks were on the menu."
"1762"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had come here ages ago for a friends birthday party where he basically ordered some ridiculous 12 course feast for us (I filled up on sashimi in the 3rd course because I had no idea - and paid the price :|) but IT WAS SO DELICIOUS."
"1763"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service was great, they explained each item since I didn't remember what any of the courses were."
"1764"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had to ask the server who served me at the cashier to clean that area up but she was fast and efficient and we got our second seat pretty fast."
"1765"|"statement"|"statement"|"After lunch at Pita Pan, I hopped over to DB Bistro, where I had visited three times previously, for their revamped menu."
"1766"|"statement"|"statement"|"We ordered coconut water to quench our thirst, what a way to get refreshed quickly!"
"1767"|"statement"|"statement"|"So that is the only reason why I'm giving it a four star rating bc I needed my champong fix and this was my only choice."
"1768"|"statement"|"statement"|"You know how it goes- a colleague tells you hey I know a good place for lunch, you go there, tell someone else in your workplace the same, and the next thing you know - half of the people sitting in the shop when you visit are people you're working with."
"1769"|"statement"|"statement"|"note to self : wear a bib when having this."
"1770"|"question"|"rhetoric"|"Honestly, why do people in Singapore still go to Crystal Jade?"
"1771"|"statement"|"statement"|"It used to be run by Fatty when it was on Rochor Road, and the business has since been handed down to his children."
"1772"|"statement"|"statement"|"Maybe that's why they served it with a heap of french fries."
"1773"|"statement"|"statement"|"Like the spring roll, it was very much what I expect in the dish."
"1774"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've been with 3-4 different groups of people, so trust me when I say it's generally a hit amongst most people I introduce to it."
"1775"|"statement"|"statement"|"We are seated at one end where we have a great view what the chefs are cooking."
"1776"|"statement"|"statement"|"I can't imagine why anyone would stop at 1 though!"

"1779"|"statement"|"statement"|"Damn, the black bean sauce and the warm, ?ber-tender, melt-in-your-mouth-and-make-you-see-god steamed aubergine was EXACTLY what I needed after a long day at work."
"1780"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, it's a bit of mystery why the sushi rolls were a bit weak, using krab in the California roll and having a bit too much rice."
"1781"|"statement"|"statement"|"UOB is cure net offering priority queue for those who did not reserve in advance, but based on experience, the wait is about the same as the normal queue."
"1782"|"statement"|"statement"|"Another of the sides we ordered, I forget what it was now, just tasted peculiar, with a sharp tartness instead of creaminess that we expected."
"1783"|"statement"|"statement"|"I go in cycles where I get obsessed with restaurants and this is my latest."
"1784"|"statement"|"statement"|"In my opinion, what separates a so so prawn noodls from a fantastic one is: (i) the flavour, (ii) quality of the broth and (iii) the freshness of the prawn."
"1785"|"statement"|"statement"|"I came here with my mom after a bumboat trip on the Singapore river looking for a some place where we could eat late without being in a very loud club-type environment so we ended up at Tomo Izikaya as it is one of the places near the Singapore river at Clarke Quay which look cosy and less crowded."
"1786"|"statement"|"statement"|"compared to what i had before, i prefer the uma ramen, e soup base just suited my taste buds better."
"1787"|"statement"|"statement"|"Verdict, among the three dishes I tried, I enjoyed what I ordered more."
"1788"|"statement"|"statement"|"The place was rather empty when we arrived."
"1789"|"statement"|"statement"|"The typical customer service I get when being seated outside is that, staff won't be able to notice us, when we need help, as they are mostly inside, clearing tables and serving other customers."
"1790"|"statement"|"statement"|"She would of called us when our table was ready but we didn't have a phone."
"1791"|"statement"|"statement"|"They are what I would term as mildly spicy."
"1792"|"statement"|"statement"|"Hubby was really full after eating his curry and questioned his judgment on why he ordered the extra topping."
"1793"|"statement"|"statement"|"Also, when I asked for a loyalty card, even though I did not meet the minimum spending, the cashier actually said that as it was my first time, she would still give it to me."
"1794"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is situated just outside the Esplanade, where you can also admire the Esplanade's unique architecture that resembles the durian."
"1795"|"statement"|"statement"|"The pastry of the BBQ Pork pastry was buttery and flaky, and tasted heavenly when accompanied by the char siew filling that was both sweet and savory at the same time."
"1796"|"question"|"question"|"where can i find good Indian food?"
"1797"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's not a fancy place by any means and is a good place to stop by when you need to grab a bite to eat with a friend or friends."
"1798"|"statement"|"statement"|"Crabs are what you come for here so get those if you get nothing else."
"1799"|"statement"|"statement"|"Convenient for people who wishes to have a bowl of hot supper after clubbing."
"1800"|"statement"|"statement"|"The stock market concept is meant to appeal to financial-types who have nosh to spend on beer after a long day slogging it out - very clever of the owners of this place!"
"1801"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's a cheap place so I can see why it's popular."
"1802"|"statement"|"statement"|"The one thing that was especially  interesting was the beer pricing, which depends on the tier of beer (there are 2 types, one being more expensive) and when you buy it (3 different blocks of time)."
"1803"|"question"|"question"|"You know those exercise programs where youre supposed to eat multiple small meals a day?"
"1804"|"statement"|"statement"|"All of the fish was common in what you can get anywhere else and the fish didn't necessarily taste a whole lot better."
"1805"|"statement"|"statement"|"I usually get a Chicken drumstick, two servings of rice (I'm Filipino what do you expect) and a triangular shaped egg."
"1806"|"statement"|"statement"|"Sticking to Robertson Quay area reviews as this is where I live and exploring my new neighbourhood."
"1807"|"statement"|"statement"|"While the name was funny, I didn't know what to think."
"1808"|"statement"|"statement"|"But the 3 star I gave is not because of the overall quality but because of slight annoyance I have when I figured the 'Hot' deli actually tasted very cold (which also happened during my visit to other MUJI cafe outside Singapore)."
"1809"|"statement"|"statement"|"40 SGD for a small variety of sashimi is extremely expensive compared to what I see in the San Francisco/San Jose area."
"1810"|"statement"|"statement"|"My 'go to' place in Singapore when you do not want to miss out on any sport from back home."
"1811"|"statement"|"statement"|"They have old fashioned wooden lounge chairs down by the water where you can enjoy a beer and contemplate the meaning of life or whatever's on your mind."
"1812"|"statement"|"statement"|"I pointed it out to a staff who said he'd look into it."
"1813"|"statement"|"statement"|"So, I was left standing outside of the restaurant  awaiting my colleagues who had made the dinner plans."
"1814"|"question"|"question"|"But who goes there for the drinks eh?"
"1815"|"statement"|"statement"|"Did a last minute check with the buddy who stays in the area as our dictionary for food is running out of ideas as we were quite limited to the usual Beef Kway Teow and Frog Porridge in Geylang for dinner."
"1816"|"statement"|"statement"|"The straight forward dish without much fanciful creations in the dish is somehow what I'm looking for."
"1817"|"statement"|"statement"|"Maybe it depends on what we ordered too."
"1818"|"statement"|"statement"|"Guess they are THAT popular and famous that they have one window to pay and another to get your food, when most hawker stallls are usually a one or two man show."
"1819"|"statement"|"statement"|"The pancakes were sooooo fluffy and when paired with the sour-ish berries and sweet syrup, it was great!"
"1820"|"statement"|"statement"|"The beef burrito wasn't what I was expecting."
"1821"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, this was one of those times where I drank all the soup, licked the bowl, and still wanted more!"
"1822"|"statement"|"statement"|"The chilli is a wonderful sort of spicy (even for me who is not the biggest fan of spicy), and even a little sweet as well."
"1823"|"statement"|"statement"|"Salmon Ikura Pasta $16.80++ Upon ordering a pasta, the staff will ask you what sauce would you like, there's tomato, cream, garlic etc."
"1824"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm pretty sure that when we arrived at 1pm, we had at least 30 people in front of us."
"1825"|"statement"|"statement"|"They are obviously still short on staff and I queued for slightly over an hour (I had nothing to do and was by myself on a Friday night so why not ) They gave me a small menu and sat me at the counter."
"1826"|"statement"|"statement"|"First thing waiter said to me when he saw me is No Tripod to take photos."
"1827"|"statement"|"statement"|"So when you want to go to a place for cocktails and for a more substantial meal, Tess Kitchen and Bar works very nicely!"
"1828"|"statement"|"statement"|"Some options come in multiples of 1, 3, 6 or 10 so make sure to carefully discern quantity when making your selections."
"1829"|"statement"|"statement"|"Upon returning he informed me that it was a completely different dish to what he introduced when he served it."
"1830"|"statement"|"statement"|"A must when you're in Singapore."
"1831"|"statement"|"statement"|"For food, this restaurant delivers what it promised: Cantonese cuisine!"
"1832"|"statement"|"statement"|"Oh, the set lunch for $9.90  is more valuable, where you have an option between a chicken or beef pho and a light snack plus coffee."
"1833"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was a little bit taken back by this, not sure how I feel about the chef serving what looked like poop to us."
"1834"|"statement"|"statement"|"But fairly tender meat, where there was it."
"1835"|"statement"|"statement"|"We looked over the menu so we could order when we sat down."
"1836"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you're bored you can check out my blog (on my profile) to find out my favorite ramen place ;)  If we're in the area we'll definitely come back when we have a ramen craving :) it's delicious and quite worth the price!"
"1837"|"statement"|"statement"|"Wow, what an impressive restaurant and such a fun and interesting dining experience."
"1838"|"statement"|"statement"|"There are also people out there who will scream until they're blue in the face that it's terrible and best avoided."
"1839"|"statement"|"statement"|"But when you take a bite, WOW, they are amazing!"
"1840"|"statement"|"statement"|"But it got really crowded at about 730pm and thats when service went down."
"1841"|"statement"|"statement"|"Unfortunately you get what you pay for."
"1842"|"statement"|"statement"|"She gave us the wrong info of this outlet being their 2nd outlet, when in fact, they have moved from their old location at Ann Siang to Amoy Street."
"1843"|"statement"|"statement"|"Comfort food in a bowl, wagyu sukiyaki don, oyako foie gras don and for those who prefer pork, the Iberico char siu don."
"1844"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is actually quite significant to me as I am one of those residents of Tiong Bahru who is against the rejuvenation of the estate simply because nearly all the cafes and eateries there are catered to a trend and the quality of their food products are usually mediocre to downright lousy."
"1845"|"statement"|"statement"|"from the seafood stalls (usually) targeting and annoying the diners who may just want to browse first before deciding on what to order."
"1846"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you could not decide on what flavour to have, why not spin the wheel which is located behind the counter."
"1847"|"statement"|"statement"|"Tastes not bad, except that I have gone through a terrible experience with the staffs when ordering the drink."
"1848"|"statement"|"statement"|"But, what I really love about beer market is the fact that Shili and Adi perform here on Thursdays and Fridays."
"1849"|"statement"|"statement"|"The good: Best ramen in Singapore (forget what the self appointed ramen heads say)."
"1850"|"statement"|"statement"|"...how would know their names... We said WARM water but were served cold water when it finally come."
"1851"|"statement"|"statement"|"Once you enter, they hand you the yellow ordering form and you tick the boxes for what you want."
"1852"|"statement"|"statement"|"If this isn't a well-balanced dish, I don't know what is."
"1853"|"statement"|"statement"|"I imagine the eating experience would be very different at peak hours when you are basically sitting on top of the person next to you."
"1854"|"statement"|"statement"|"We are nice people, and my husband is the most polite and friendliest person I know, however when he asked for more toast, twice, he got blank stares or was plainly ignored by the female staff, just left standing."
"1855"|"statement"|"statement"|"And then the dry version after the noodle has soaked up all the gravy when you are on your 2nd or 3rd plate."
"1856"|"statement"|"statement"|"The set up is super efficient - one dude goes up the line asking for your rice/porridge orders, and sets the tray in front of the the guy who dishes out the... dishes."
"1857"|"statement"|"statement"|"That said, the food tasted superb, and when I chatted with another table of tourists sitting across us, they also knew the price range and so it seems like everyone who comes here knows what they are getting into."
"1858"|"statement"|"statement"|"Nothing exciting, except for their buns ... which why would anyone come to an expensive restaurant for buns."
"1859"|"statement"|"statement"|"Bang for your buck when you want a quick grub."
"1860"|"statement"|"statement"|"That's why you'll have A WHALE OF A TIME."
"1861"|"statement"|"statement"|"I find it reasonably difficult to get a single drink from the simplest food court to the finest restaurant here, so the fact that this modest place can do it right makes me wonder why so few others choose not to."
"1862"|"statement"|"statement"|"The draft beer menu was on the board and had what I considered to be quite a large selection of beers all served on tap."
"1863"|"question"|"question"|"how to heal my heavy heart? "
"1864"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is the kind of place for the lazy people who dont really like to be bothered with choosing your main course - there's only one main course here -- 2 portions of steak and fries!"
"1865"|"statement"|"statement"|"The restaurant was totally empty when we visited after lunch hour."
"1866"|"statement"|"statement"|"steamed fish (so-so, the soup I like to drink at the end was quite sour) mushroom abalone and veggies (good - imo cannot go wrong) fried noodles (so-so, not too salty, and there were fresh scallops) yam paste (I have never liked yam paste :P but  others said it was good) shou tao (nice filling, but too much skin) fruits were standard watermelon honeydew apple  I have no idea what the dishes were exactly though because I wasn't the one who ordered (grandma's birthday)."
"1867"|"statement"|"statement"|"To begin with, there's too much light inside, so most of what we could see through the glass was a reflection of what was happening behind us."
"1868"|"statement"|"statement"|"For example, Korean Boss BarBQ considers themselves to serve 4 course when it's actually just 1 main course of meat dish+ rice+soup+side dishes."
"1869"|"statement"|"statement"|"Definitely go when it's open as you don't want to miss out on a Singaporean dessert treat!"
"1870"|"statement"|"statement"|"it's cheap for being in town, and an almost mindless option if you're in one of those moods when food needs to fill rather than sate - but otherwise, cross the road to the sushi tei at paragon (my favorite branch of the chain)."
"1871"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is the only Yakitori place you'll ever need when you r in Singapore."
"1872"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm not sure what it is about this place that keeps me coming back."
"1873"|"statement"|"statement"|"Perhaps I would have a better experience if I came with a local or somebody who knows what they are doing."
"1874"|"statement"|"statement"|"This Japanese pasta place is one of my favourite options when I come to Food Republic in 313!"
"1875"|"statement"|"statement"|"115, who is 115 the assistant behind the counter shouts."
"1876"|"statement"|"statement"|"Ok, why not, let's try it."
"1877"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Japanese are really good at what they do, regardless of the cuisine."
"1878"|"statement"|"statement"|"I will probably bring my family here when they visit."
"1879"|"statement"|"statement"|"While I applaud the effort to revive an old eating haunt, the way it's done and the food that is served here is far from what it used to be in the past."
"1880"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's hard to get really good salad, especially when it's Duck."
"1881"|"statement"|"statement"|"So, really, Jai Thai is nearrrrrly at 5 stars for me, but what they do have is crazy good."
"1882"|"statement"|"statement"|"I am amazed at the amount of people who chill here around 10 AM on weekdays, both locals and expats."
"1883"|"statement"|"statement"|"I could not suppress my excitement and wanted to find out what magic has gone into this sandwich."
"1884"|"statement"|"statement"|"We also got a vegetarian mushroom dish (I can't remember what its was called, but again, just delicious) as well as this dish of Chinese noodles swimming in a wonderful seafood sauce with tons of calamari and baby octopus (yum!"
"1885"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's definitely the place to go if you are looking for a quick bite when you are feeling peckish in the afternoon or if you want, order the large and have it for a 'full' meal."
"1886"|"question"|"question"|"So what sets the Butchers Club Burger apart form the rest of the crowd?"
"1887"|"statement"|"statement"|":)  What I Love: Love the style of the place."
"1888"|"statement"|"statement"|"it's a small menu of mains, rather pricey - and when it arrives, it barely feels worth it."
"1889"|"statement"|"statement"|"But it's no better than what you'd find in a 7-11 or such."
"1890"|"statement"|"statement"|"Jim Thompson sets the tone immediately when you arrive."
"1891"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've eaten at many a food truck and hole-in-the-wall type places south of the border, I know what I'm talking about."
"1892"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have such a nostalgic attachment to Tiong Bahru Bakery - it was one of the first cafes I visited when I was rediscovering the new old Tiong Bahru and I dare anyone to resist their drool inducing displays!"
"1893"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm not sure why people would classify the restaurant as pricey when given the quality of the food, portions, decor and service, it really is the farthest thing from pricey."
"1894"|"statement"|"statement"|"Serve this dish with rice or youtiao and your in heaven  Depending on who you are, you're either a peppery clear soup Bak Kut Teh kind of guy or the Herbal Soup Bak Kut Teh aficionado."
"1895"|"statement"|"statement"|"I will say, though, be prepared when you go in there."
"1896"|"statement"|"statement"|"But that's not why I go there ;)  They have a dish that makes me want to stop everything to rush and eat it."
"1897"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's one of the only places in Singapore where I am willing to wait for my food so may I say: SHIOK!!"
"1898"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's not everyday you can dine at a mall where you get to people watch without a window in between."
"1899"|"question"|"question"|"The food selection itself was also not what we expected - we ended up with indian food (butter chicken?"
"1900"|"statement"|"statement"|"that's where the easy parts end."
"1901"|"statement"|"statement"|"So if you are having dinner next door, come by and order it in advance and they will call you when it's ready."
"1902"|"statement"|"statement"|"So we ordered what they had - the bacalao baked with cheese and the goats cheese salad."
"1903"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was too full I couldn't stomach any more stuff no matter what delicacy from heaven it is."
"1904"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is a restaurant where you can eat a generally not bad buffet without burning a hole in your pockets."
"1905"|"statement"|"statement"|"Back to dinner -  What we found out after we opted for the shorter classic menu was that the menu only gives a preview of what you will get."
"1906"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's really hard to get Pork Satay and I remember lovin' it in Bali - when I had Pork Satay almost every other day - so it was a pleasant surprise to mix and match, Chicken, Pork and Lamb Satay - and the marinade is really yummy."
"1907"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service/Experience: Staff is woefully unprepared which is why everything is so slow."
"1908"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had asked for rare, and dark chunks of over-cooked beef and foie gras (meagre serving) was just not what I had hoped for."
"1909"|"statement"|"statement"|"Finally for dessert, I had a really remarkable dessert made of thinly sliced pineapple with what tasted like lime jelly and a scoop of coconut ice cream."
"1910"|"rhetoric"|"rhetoric"|"Why say it's good when it is not?!?!"
"1911"|"statement"|"statement"|"There's a reason people put up with the difficulty of making a reservation, and the wait for your table even when you do have a rez...and the reason is quality and enjoyment derived from the food."
"1912"|"statement"|"statement"|"I ate my Donburi as I fast can, which was good, but no where near the quality of the Wagyu dish sitting across from me."
"1913"|"statement"|"statement"|"And when I'm at the restaurant, I prefer to dine al fresco with a thirst quenching Paulaner in hand :)"
"1914"|"statement"|"statement"|"Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars:  The experience was marred from the beginning when I saw the email on Tuesday (they sent it Sunday afternoon, but I didn't check email till Tuesday...some people are not chained by email :p) where it asked if I could change my dining time to 11.30 am or 11.45 am instead of 12 pm."
"1915"|"statement"|"statement"|"I ordered the chilli crab cuz that's what I came for."
"1916"|"statement"|"statement"|"Bearing this in mind, I think she did a great job - she was very courteous, apologising profusely when one of orders was mixed up and was really attentive to our table."
"1917"|"question"|"question"|"I had angel hair sort of alio-olio but with a twist (I still don't know what the twist was, but it was good: sakura ebi paste?"
"1918"|"statement"|"statement"|"Also fantastic for drunk people watching at 4 am in the morning when you are hungry and cannot go to bed."
"1919"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, there was some small mishap at the spa when I first went down trying to make an appointment, because, nobody was answering my call there."
"1920"|"statement"|"statement"|"A must have meal when in Singapore!"
"1921"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you are one those laksa fans, you won't be disappointed by what this stall has to offer."
"1922"|"statement"|"statement"|"My two female colleagues baulked when they saw me approaching the table with 2 plates of $3 noodles (this, as recommended by an uncle standing in line in front of me when I asked for a $5 plate- he convinced me that 2 $3 plates was more worth it - I guess it's true!"
"1923"|"statement"|"statement"|":-)  Restaurant: It's really just a place where you eat and leave."
"1924"|"statement"|"statement"|"My friends' meals were done perfectly to their taste but when mine came I was terribly disappointed - it was medium well and not medium rare that I asked for."
"1925"|"statement"|"statement"|"Indeed, when I was there for lunch one weekday, there were only three tables filled, including ours."
"1926"|"statement"|"statement"|"I can drink two cups in one night when I'm really thirsty."
"1927"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have to admit this place wasn't the easiest to find but the food is good and it comes out very quick after you order even when it's a full house!"
"1928"|"statement"|"statement"|"There's even a column to differentiate your first and second orders - a knowing nod to Singaporeans who love to gorge themselves on repeat orders like yours truly."
"1929"|"statement"|"statement"|"The soup was average, not sure why a chunk of corn in a broth is classed as soup."
"1930"|"statement"|"statement"|"$36 for a Gordon's cocktail... What was I thinking."
"1931"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm a huge fan of The Sushi Bar at Far East Plaza, so I was pretty psyched when I heard they were opening up another location down the road at Ngee Ann City."
"1932"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were not sure on what to expect when we read frozen foie gras."
"1933"|"statement"|"statement"|"As someone who is personally fascinated by the religion, this dimension makes me enjoy my meals at Ci Yan even more."
"1934"|"statement"|"statement"|"I only go when I have some visitors from overseas, but I always enjoy the food there."
"1935"|"statement"|"statement"|"Where the sushi is obtained from, and who the chef buys his fish from."
"1936"|"statement"|"statement"|"I spent many years living in Georgia so I know what is delicious southern food!"
"1937"|"statement"|"statement"|"We got there right at the time of our reservation, we were asked to wait, and after some time we are told that because they have too many reservations they are giving us a table in their other restaurant next door (Masa) where we could order of of their menu."
"1938"|"statement"|"statement"|"This restaurant is not on my radar of must-try places; the only reason why I came here was because Nik T. and Jireh H. were hangin' here for the Super Bowl!"
"1939"|"statement"|"statement"|"i don't even really recall what was in it, but i think it had some veggies and spare ribs."
"1940"|"statement"|"statement"|"A little pricey for their food, but its a place where you can consider going during special occasions or sort."
"1941"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've had such high expectations for their soup dumplings that when they came out, I was a little disappointed."
"1942"|"statement"|"statement"|"This location is located on the top floor of the Wisma Atria which was super easy to get to from the Grand Hyatt where we were staying."
"1943"|"statement"|"statement"|"There was a surprise birthday party in the lounge section that evening I was there and it turned out to be my friend's cousin who booked it for his sister."
"1944"|"statement"|"statement"|"The stall can be recognized by the music playing out of the boombox, and the auntie who takes orders very quickly."
"1945"|"statement"|"statement"|"I understand why the queues here are out of control."
"1946"|"statement"|"statement"|"As per other places in Singapore, drinks are expensive but what can you do."
"1947"|"statement"|"statement"|"There is a line, when inside half of the tables are empty."
"1948"|"question"|"question"|"Specials for just $2   For $2, what meal can you get in the Dhoby Ghaut area?"
"1949"|"statement"|"statement"|"The fois nigiri is simply my favorite bite of food at Uchi, and perhaps in the world, so when I saw fois donburi on the menu at the Fat Cow I knew where I was going to eat."
"1950"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just like everyone else mentioned, be ready to queue (that's what local ppl say here in Singapore... having brought up in California, I just say be ready to stand in line) upon arrival."
"1951"|"statement"|"statement"|"The fried chicken had a crazy ginger marinade, was crispy and hot when served with a tangy lime/ garlic/ ginger sauce."
"1952"|"statement"|"statement"|"We waited for one hour but when we asked the waitress, she didn't say sorry at all, just say it's table by table."
"1953"|"statement"|"statement"|"I confess to forgetting exactly what we had for starters and mains, but I do remember all of us being quite impressed, particularly with the mains."
"1954"|"statement"|"statement"|"I love tapas bars so when I heard Jason Atherton had opened one in Singapore, I quickly rounded up a couple of friends to check it out."
"1955"|"statement"|"statement"|"Make sure you give the noodles a quick toss when you get it so it's evenly mixed or the sauce really just sits at the bottom of the bowl."
"1956"|"statement"|"statement"|"The other really attractive thing about Nickeldime is their willingness to do flights or tasters, which is a huge plus if a place has more than  4 taps and you'd like to taste all the beers on tap and get a relatively sound sense of what each beer is about."
"1957"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think I got a bit too addicted to the broth and the leftover broth was very enjoyable when eaten together with warm rice."
"1958"|"statement"|"statement"|"It does a good job in looking welcoming, and because it's essentially a really simple shoppe it does not feel intimidating to be in there, when it might seem that way in many other shops selling similar items."
"1959"|"statement"|"statement"|"To be really honest, there was hardly any beefy aroma when the bowl hit the table."
"1960"|"statement"|"statement"|"But when I got there shortly after 5, I was turned away by staff saying that the promo ended at 5."
"1961"|"statement"|"statement"|"A a bit of a Do-it-yourself burger where you take a strip of pork belly put it inside a steam bun."
"1962"|"question"|"question"|"Pricey, but hey, when in Singapore, right?"
"1963"|"statement"|"statement"|"Everyone is so joyful even when they get busy or are tired."
"1964"|"statement"|"statement"|"I suppose Bak Kut Teh is to me what chicken rice is to most other people."
"1965"|"statement"|"statement"|"Other than that, choose from a variety of yakitori (there is a grill counter in the corner of the restaurant where the chef prepares the grilled items), sashimi, tempura and cooked items."
"1966"|"statement"|"statement"|"So I was disappointed and wonder still why the reviews are so good."
"1967"|"statement"|"statement"|"When ordering, you are supposed to tell them exactly where you are seated (basically screwed if someone else takes your seat) or they will refuse to let you order until you have found an alternative seat."
"1968"|"statement"|"statement"|"I normally decide to cool down in your air conditioned cafe, where I enjoy listening to your awesome pop playlist."
"1969"|"statement"|"statement"|"I will not comment on the food quality since it's McDonalds and you know what you are getting yourself into (we all have our reasons to be there)."
"1970"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was as if clouds took rice form and were cooked in an amazing broth of just right seasoning - that is what the rice is like from TianTian."
"1971"|"statement"|"statement"|"People who put 5 stars here are either rich or ignorant"
"1972"|"statement"|"statement"|"My dad used to make this for me when I was younger, so it was a sweet blast to the past for me!"
"1973"|"statement"|"statement"|"First thought when it arrived: the broth is so so oily!"
"1974"|"statement"|"statement"|"The mixed crispy vegetables with Thai sweet chilli is a must have regardless of what you order."
"1975"|"statement"|"statement"|"I always trust the recommendations for Korean cuisine from friends who have been to Korea and Togi was one of them."
"1976"|"statement"|"statement"|"This was definitely a case where the picture looked MUCH better than the actual dish!"
"1977"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, the service was very inattentive, nothing close to the reception one should receive when paying these kinds of prices for food in Singapore."
"1978"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"And when I mentioned Paul Bakery, what is the first thing that comes to mind?"
"1979"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's not dirt cheap but you get a pretty good portion for what you're paying (about $4-6) and it's filling!"
"1980"|"statement"|"statement"|"Parking is rather difficult as the restaurant is located in quite a snazzy hot spot where both locals and tourists frequent for food and drinks."
"1981"|"statement"|"statement"|"He even told me to keep my eyes peeled when I get up escalators and spot random strange men standing around by themselves."
"1982"|"statement"|"statement"|"And the audioguide is great for visitors, because I saw one guide in Japanese, and that would not have been a language on any of the walls, but now those visitors can understand what the museum is showing them."
"1983"|"statement"|"statement"|"I personally found the food a little oily, and so did another friend, who felt that this more or less masked the overall taste, so it was hard to tell if it was fresh or not."
"1984"|"statement"|"statement"|"You tell them what you want and they quickly give you a plate of tasty hot food."
"1985"|"statement"|"statement"|"This place is very interesting as it is run totally by volunteers and patrons pay what they like."
"1986"|"statement"|"statement"|"Also, they were nice enough to let us move to the smoking area on the patio after the staff dried everything off (I don't know why they weren't prepared for the daily rainstorms we have!)"
"1987"|"statement"|"statement"|"All the other reviewers have already told you what to have, but here's the play by play recap:  Fish Thai-style."
"1988"|"statement"|"statement"|"This place is lovely to unwind after the hustle bustle of school (for those who are studying at SMU) or for those who would like some good acoustic music to chill to."
"1989"|"statement"|"statement"|"Overall definitely no where close to authentic Mexican food but considering their tacos are typically $18 it is a steal."
"1990"|"statement"|"statement"|"Being a more 'average joe' when it comes to cuisine, I was timid about coming to a restaurant like this, expecting it to be outside my realm of appreciation."
"1991"|"statement"|"statement"|"Everything is freshly baked, the staff is super friendly, and they really know what they are doing!"
"1992"|"statement"|"statement"|"I guess I'm not very adventurous when it comes to Chinese food, especially because there is usually a heavy focus on seafood and I'm not a fan of seafood."
"1993"|"statement"|"statement"|"I left the place feeling horrible and had to tell all my friends who were on the way to change a place."
"1994"|"statement"|"statement"|"There's always that long queue in the morning, so I try to avoid it and go in the afternoon instead, where the breakfast crowd has subsided and half the Raffles Place population have been chained to their screens."
"1995"|"statement"|"statement"|"I decided to go on a walkabout and see where I ended up."
"1996"|"statement"|"statement"|"And what I love most about Conrad is that amidst the mad crowds and bustle of the Marina Square and Suntec, you can always seek solace and peace in luxury there."
"1997"|"statement"|"statement"|"We will miss places like Mr. Prata when we leave Singapore!"
"1998"|"statement"|"statement"|"he was the one who lead us to the the table."
"1999"|"statement"|"statement"|"When I saw the long queue outside and the abundance of tables inside when I enter, I was surprised and thought it must be an awesome marketing strategy!"
"2000"|"statement"|"statement"|"In particular, the dim sum items are hot favorites as what is served at Bosses is probably more exquisite than what you commonly get outside."
"2001"|"statement"|"statement"|"Somehow when the food is no longer cooked by the original owners, the standard is not the same."
"2002"|"statement"|"statement"|"The other servers could only stare in surprise when we walked out and didn't even bother to ask if they could assist or what's the issue."
"2003"|"statement"|"statement"|"The eclairs had toppings that helped distinguish what eclairs they were."
"2004"|"statement"|"statement"|"In addition, the steak was not sliced properly in the kitchen and when we requested for it to be properly sliced."
"2005"|"statement"|"statement"|"if you want to know what teething problems are for a newly opened restaurant then you need look no further than the ramen play here."
"2006"|"statement"|"statement"|"Also, when I asked about the latte tasting weak, the barista came over and recommended the piccolo."
"2007"|"statement"|"statement"|"Actually, my dinner at Podi did not turn out as bad as the online reviews, perhaps because we picked the right dishes and it was a non-crowded weekday evening when you can dine at ease with less noise pollution."
"2008"|"statement"|"statement"|"For $118 per pax, it's twice as much as what we paid for dim sum last year."
"2009"|"statement"|"statement"|"Pick what you want from a huge selection of food stalls."
"2010"|"statement"|"statement"|"Way too overpriced for what they have to offer."
"2011"|"statement"|"statement"|"The only reason I give it 3 stars is because it feels slightly pricey for what I'm getting."
"2012"|"statement"|"statement"|"for those who can remember, there was an old rasa singapura."
"2013"|"statement"|"statement"|"For those of you who have been hiding under a rock or just plain ignorant yet think highly of themselves, they have 3 shops in Singapore."
"2014"|"statement"|"statement"|"you are crazy, just like the rest of us "
"2015"|"statement"|"statement"|"But when I was there with a friend, we asked the waitress twice how many sides we get."
"2016"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's one of those places where you can dine there every fortnight without feeling bored."
"2017"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was still tasty, just not what I was expecting."
"2018"|"statement"|"statement"|"SINGAPORE CHILI CRAB This was the dish that took my breath away when I saw it on Instagram, so I was very excited about it."
"2019"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service was excellent, we were served by an Indian waiter who was so friendly, helpful and attentive."
"2020"|"statement"|"statement"|"And the water jug - where you literally scoop water with a ladle into a tiny paper cup - is ridiculous."
"2021"|"statement"|"statement"|"wow, national kitchen what big shoes to fill!"
"2022"|"statement"|"statement"|"I really wanted to give this place 4* but when you trot out $5 or so per plate of dim sum, the expectations do go up and it's a shame."
"2023"|"statement"|"statement"|"anyway, just when he thought dinner was over, you moved him into a much cosier environment for his just desserts!"
"2024"|"statement"|"statement"|"To sum it up, I just know what good Yeung chow fried rice tastes like."
"2025"|"statement"|"statement"|"I am not exactly sure what ingredients went into it, but it was more amazing than the yakitori itself."
"2026"|"statement"|"statement"|"I used to frequent Bao Today frequently when their Raflles Place branch was still open, so I know they serve pretty good dim sum."
"2027"|"statement"|"statement"|"Immediately when you exit you are met by a very chic, classy ambiance."
"2028"|"statement"|"statement"|"A bit messy but that's probably because I'm a westerner and have no idea what I'm doing."
"2029"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service can be spotty - though I understand it is hard to provide excellent attentive service when a restaurant is super crowded."
"2030"|"statement"|"statement"|"I enjoyed the juicy bursts from the pomelo when I bit into them."
"2031"|"statement"|"statement"|"I recommend this place for those who want to experience a different dining or on a special date."
"2032"|"question"|"rhetoric"|"Of course you can eat slowly to spend more time in the shop, but why deprive others of their noodles?"
"2033"|"question"|"rhetoric"|"Okay, so, you happen to be in a foreign city experiencing a foreign culture, why on Earth would you go into a place that basically reminded you of home?"
"2034"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was less than what it looked."
"2035"|"statement"|"statement"|"Soup of the day was a creamy tomato soup... can't be sure what it is."
"2036"|"statement"|"statement"|"On the menu, the chicken were in shreds but when it was served, it was 2 large pieces of chicken thighs with the bone in."
"2037"|"statement"|"statement"|"The system is a little confusing for those who like to line up."
"2038"|"statement"|"statement"|"I rate it a 4 because when I feel like having a green tea latte..I can have a big tasty one here with a specified sweetness (25% for me) for $4.50 instead of going opposite to Starbucks to pay $5.20 to $5.70 for a smaller one."
"2039"|"statement"|"statement"|"Instead of going to pay for my bill, I sat down and noticed the crowd going to the counter and I was wondering why - figured out that was the payment area shortly."
"2040"|"statement"|"statement"|"I am a strong supporter of bicycles as a mean of transport, and I sometimes miss those Sundays back home when they close some main avenues so we can cycle just for recreation."
"2041"|"statement"|"statement"|"And yes, I was thrilled when I heard that we are going to try out the buffet here."
"2042"|"statement"|"statement"|"And frankly I don't think the stalls here are that superior than what you find in a local joint."
"2043"|"statement"|"statement"|"Instead of apologizing for the miserable portion, she actually provided an explanation of how the kitchen hasn't figured out how to 'fix it', and that at certain times of the year, when the price of the mussels increase, they cannot serve the same weight of mussels!!!"
"2044"|"statement"|"statement"|"We walked in after chancing upon it when we were trying to look for a nice place with Prosecco that we can sit, eat and chill along Circular Road."
"2045"|"statement"|"statement"|"tuna, salmon, fish roe, scallops and 2 other sashimis which I'm not too sure what they are called."
"2046"|"statement"|"statement"|"Now this is what hawking food is all about."
"2047"|"statement"|"statement"|"This place is open late, and who doesn't like a place that is open late, sure they might not have the best chicken rice but they are open to the whee hours of the night."
"2048"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had the bangers & mash, while my partner had a lasagna (can't remember what exactly it's called)."
"2049"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'll be coming back to SG regularly and will stay here when I do"
"2050"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have tried queuing or getting friends in the area to queue at various times between 11.30am to 2pm and have only found two time slots where the order queue was short and even then, the collection was still ridiculous."
"2051"|"statement"|"statement"|"me and my friend left the table to decide on the cakes we wanted and when we returned to the table, voila!"
"2052"|"statement"|"statement"|"Well, when I was here it was still reasonably early on a Monday morning, so most of the shops were closed, but there were still enough for me to partake in some of the offerings."
"2053"|"statement"|"statement"|"Don't go with the kind of friend who eats meat and leaves the skin behind."
"2054"|"statement"|"statement"|"Besides the seafood and sashimi, there was also plenty of other dishes so much so that my parents who are picky eaters did not have a complain at all."
"2055"|"statement"|"statement"|"Don't kick a fuss when u ask for warm water only."
"2056"|"statement"|"statement"|"Second, we liked what they did with the small alfresco space outside adding a bar snacks menu."
"2057"|"statement"|"statement"|"I love all Din Tai Fung no matter where they are... this one is extra great because they have a wine list."
"2058"|"statement"|"statement"|"I used to come here a lot when I was in Secondary school."
"2059"|"question"|"question"|"it was late but who can resist eating a piece of still piping hot golden fried chicken?"
"2060"|"statement"|"statement"|"Angelina Tea Room And Patisserie was full house when we arrived but we were quite surprised to find no queue in front of us."
"2061"|"statement"|"statement"|"As a French national who has eaten many a souffle, be it cheese, raspberry or Grand Marnier, I did not recognize that bowl as belonging to that family."
"2062"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is where I was first introduced to Murtabak and it has spoiled all others to follow."
"2063"|"question"|"question"|"I mean god.. what did eggs become so expensive in Singapore?"
"2064"|"statement"|"statement"|"overall highly recommended for those who love authentic yummy ramen."
"2065"|"question"|"question"|"What kind of restaurant does keep track of when their ingredients would come?"
"2066"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is probably not going to be the tastiest chicken rice but that's exactly what I like about it."
"2067"|"statement"|"statement"|"I tried guo qiao mi xian a couple of times when I was in Yunnan China."
"2068"|"statement"|"statement"|"Good location for a drink on the river (wine or beer ....the cocktails are watered down versions of what they are meant tone)."
"2069"|"statement"|"statement"|"When people  ask me what the is to do in Singapore my first answer is always: Eat!"
"2070"|"statement"|"statement"|"The rooftop bar is where the good view is."
"2071"|"statement"|"statement"|"We noticed that our iOS Maps application was a little confused about where this restaurant was and none of the car GPS systems had the new routes in place - that reminds me, I have to go hassle my dealer for that maps upgrade!"
"2072"|"statement"|"statement"|"The line is usually a bit long, and the lady there who is in charge keeps it moving (very organized)."
"2073"|"statement"|"statement"|"ambiance//***** what fun!~ i walked in an immediately recognized dale chihuly's works in the dining areas....the lobby's tea lounge has a set and mirrored at the breakfast/lunch/dinner area is another set of his gorgeous blown glass  i also enjoyed walking around the two-story waterfall inside that leads you from lobby to the pool....it's nice just to get away from the heat outside!"
"2074"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was down to my last Singapore dollars and had to budget tightly with what I ordered."
"2075"|"statement"|"statement"|"And personally, the quality of the buffet spread is actually quite good which makes the price (which is in the $50-60 range depending on what is on the seasonal buffet menu) quite worth it."
"2076"|"statement"|"statement"|"Their blender was not working when I went there so I couldn't order ice blended drinks but the recommended the Queen Bee iced drink."
"2077"|"statement"|"statement"|"She really took care of myself and my friend who got a room during our stay."
"2078"|"statement"|"statement"|"Well i guess that's a good thing since when i recently visited, i found the place quiet and peaceful (also empty) during brunch time on a Saturday."
"2079"|"statement"|"statement"|"*I can't remember what these were called!"
"2080"|"statement"|"statement"|"The remaining star comes from the fact that my companions seemed to quite enjoy their food and the decent portions, and we were served by an exceptionally friendly waiter, who was key to our whole experience being delightful overall."
"2081"|"statement"|"statement"|"The version served here is easier on the palette for those who do not like the taste of beancurd skin or fermented bean paste."
"2082"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Long Bar at the historic Raffles Hotel is one of those things you have to do when coming to Singapore for the first time."
"2083"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"what the hell is this recommendation? "
"2084"|"statement"|"statement"|"It seemed pretty decent, yet nothing mind blowing (especially when you hope the truffle taste would be real prevalent)."
"2085"|"statement"|"statement"|"On the third level where we dine in the lounge bar as the dining room in level 2 was fully reserved."
"2086"|"statement"|"statement"|"The open kitchen concept is good, I guess, but it loses a lot when half the seats have no view of the kitchen, instead being treated to the view of a brick wall."
"2087"|"rhetoric"|"rhetoric"|"I could go for some ice cream so why not?"
"2088"|"statement"|"statement"|"Super chill out vibe at a corner shophouse where Archipelago used to be."
"2089"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service is very iffy here, and they are quite under-staffed, but you can't ask for too much when you're not paying top dollar for reasonably acceptable food."
"2090"|"statement"|"statement"|"When she came to take the order, she started giggling when my friend started asking her questions about the food & the restaurant's specialty dish."
"2091"|"statement"|"statement"|"As someone who has made her own acai bowls on a regular basis, I will tell you, IT IS NOT CHEAP getting these ingredients."
"2092"|"statement"|"statement"|"Hence, unless your idea of brunch is a small sandwich, pastry or cake, you may be disappointed when you visit."
"2093"|"question"|"question"|"So what makes Sampo so special?"
"2094"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've always been curious about this hidden outlet in Robinson's, so when the opportunity arose, I invited a friend for a drink here so I could check out their bar."
"2095"|"statement"|"statement"|"To be fair, this is where you enjoy atmosphere from the service and the decor rather than portion of of the food and drinks."
"2096"|"statement"|"statement"|"Caveat emptor - do not commit the folly that my husband and I recently did (unless you are a belly tuna afficionado) - blithely nodding when the sushi chef offered us the belly tuna just in from Japan."
"2097"|"statement"|"statement"|"To peg it as very spicy is to be extremely kind, which explains why there's a big jug of water placed on each table."
"2098"|"statement"|"statement"|"Nothing spectacular, a safe bet in terms of cocktails, where the mixologists mix according to what you feel like."
"2099"|"statement"|"statement"|"the noodles had a stronger yellow hue than what i'm used to."
"2100"|"statement"|"statement"|"Got berated by a service staff when I requested for a second serving of tartar sauce - apparently it is only ethical to put up this request after you have licked up every last bit of the sauce that is on your plate."
"2101"|"rhetoric"|"rhetoric"|"So, why the 3 star rating?"
"2102"|"statement"|"statement"|"The seats at the long table was uncomfortable, and the whole place feels gloomy when there's few customers but resembles a fish market when crowded."
"2103"|"statement"|"statement"|"Thai food flavours are just intense and varied, coupled with influences from Tex Mex, Japanese and Chinese food, you get this amazing offering, which is what they do here, and really well too."
"2104"|"statement"|"statement"|"It can tend to get a bit too noisy around as many families with children appear to like to come here and at least when I have been there it has been the type of people who do not feel like telling their kids to behave and take it easy so if that disturbs you it may not be the best place."
"2105"|"statement"|"statement"|"Lobster rolls don't require waiter service, especially when the service standard is this lackluster"
"2106"|"statement"|"statement"|"(http://www.mrktstore.com/product/pandora-5/)   Manicurious is a fabulous find and is definitely worth a visit when you get tired of trawling through the markets for cutesy cheap Asian stuff."
"2107"|"statement"|"statement"|"* in case you are wondering what for me the best sushi is: without a doubt I would pick a place in Japan."
"2108"|"statement"|"statement"|"A full bar inside and another outside where the smoking area is."
"2109"|"statement"|"statement"|"The prosciutto tasted extra salty and it looked very dark and the eggs where overcooked."
"2110"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's a different style of Mexican fusion from what you get in California with the gogi trucks- it's a less-spicy and healthier (with more veggies and ingredients) that truly fit the Korean palette."
"2111"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had no idea what mookata was and thought my friends were referring to a New Zealand haka when they suggested dinner here."
"2112"|"question"|"question"|"There are some fine dining places where yes, I feel like, why am I even here?"
"2113"|"statement"|"statement"|"Regardless of what the address says, DO NOT try and find it via Amoy Street."
"2114"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service was excellent, she was attentive, served next food just when we were finishing one, kept coming back to pour more wine, changed a plate for each dish served."
"2115"|"statement"|"statement"|"Sing with me   Da hilllllls are aaaallliivveeee  With the sound of fooodies  Where soda comes in apple strudel flavouuur  Da hills are allliiive  With the sound of foodies  Where duck papardelle and sausages remain supreme   Drop the beat down   Food: good  Atmosphere : awesome but no twirling  Service : no nuns or singing groups..."
"2116"|"statement"|"statement"|"Inside this proverbial barn is a restaurant, bike shop, a pop-up bar/cider stand, and what I swear is a stage concert."
"2117"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Vibe is exactly how a Morton's should be and the people who work their are awesome."
"2118"|"statement"|"statement"|"I always roll in after happy hour, when the DJ is letting that beat rock, all the tables are taken, and the crowd is collectively cheering that it's the freakin' weekend."
"2119"|"statement"|"statement"|"While it did not taste oily when we were devouring the wings, the greasiness set in after that."
"2120"|"statement"|"statement"|"Guys, here's when you know modern society is going nuts."
"2121"|"statement"|"statement"|"I absolutely loved the vibe of the place, which is where you can go to see how the locals eat."
"2122"|"statement"|"statement"|"Observing this young chap throughout our meal, I find that he is full of passion on what he is doing, his service was friendly and he really took extra efforts to take care of his customers well by communicating with them."
"2123"|"question"|"question"|"yeah, good idea, got better one? "
"2124"|"statement"|"statement"|"Barca thump Sevilla yesterday night"
"2125"|"statement"|"statement"|"They already open since 2007, when you visit, you will find a lot Picture of Indonesian Actor and Actress who had visited that place."
"2126"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think what makes Bratworks at ORP all the more sad is that I never see the owners around."
"2127"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is particularly egregious in a food paradise of a city where you can get better at hawker centers for $2-$5 per plate easily."
"2128"|"question"|"question"|"My colleagues find this place extremely overpriced, but what trendy place in Tiong Bahru isn't?"
"2129"|"statement"|"statement"|"The manage Min is a rock star bartender, who can make several suggestions as to some of the better bars in the area."
"2130"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, great beer, and I would give it another go, but watch out for the zealous staff (or go with somebody who will drink that other beer)."
"2131"|"statement"|"statement"|"I listen obligatorily to the server's repertoire as they roll the meat cart around, explaining and pointing to the various cuts in a well-rehearsed manner, and managing to stifle a giggle when they pick up the lobster with its claws flailing about."
"2132"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is a good option to dine here when other places are packed as they are very fast in serving the food."
"2133"|"statement"|"statement"|"They use fresh ahi tuna for the salad and the romaine lettuce at least didn't wilt nor did they drench it in dressing - which is a common thing in Singapore when you order a salad."
"2134"|"question"|"question"|"Misses include their white chocolate cheesecake (I don't know what it was... Too sweet?"
"2135"|"statement"|"statement"|"This was compounded by the fact that they were very determined to close up and literally burnt my mouth trying to hurry to eat what I waited 40 minutes for past the rest of my order."
"2136"|"statement"|"statement"|"It strikes me as one of those places set up by a banker who wanted to eat his homeland snack but couldn't get it anywhere, so he bought state of the art equipment and hired some kid to stand behind the counter."
"2137"|"statement"|"statement"|"There are not many places left in Singapore where you can get strong, potent drinks for $10 or maybe even less."
"2138"|"statement"|"statement"|"The kadaif pastry (noodly phyllo dough) was left too long over the fire and was pretty charred when it came to the table (see photo)."
"2139"|"statement"|"statement"|"I really enjoy the maki rolls from this place because there are quirky references to the sushi roll everywhere plus the ingredients are fresh and healthy (depending on what you select to go in it, of course)."
"2140"|"statement"|"statement"|"Didn't try it this time round, but will definately go back when I feel like a green tea latte as they are so hard to find :)"
"2141"|"statement"|"statement"|"I asked what is popular, she said depends on individual."
"2142"|"statement"|"statement"|"For the tsuke taste was not too bad but if you want something hot when it is cold and rainy out side this won't be it."
"2143"|"statement"|"statement"|"The caf? is manned by their regular staff, and sitting by the bar will give you the opportunity to talk to them and hear of their adventures (and, boy, do they have lots of wanderlust-worthy stories to share) when it's a slow day."
"2144"|"statement"|"statement"|"I am a fan because of the memories I get when I go there."
"2145"|"statement"|"statement"|"I, on the other hand, love picking meat of the bones as that's where all the flavours are."
"2146"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is where I'd come to grab a quick drink before / after dinner, and is also a good place to meet a date for drinks."
"2147"|"statement"|"statement"|"Somehow it really feels like your own living room and I think that's what gets me to return time and time again."
"2148"|"statement"|"statement"|"Stewed in salted fish and prawns in a coconut gravy, the chunks of young jackfruits were short of the typical pungency of a jackfruit, hence those who usually stay away from jackfruits may enjoy this dish."
"2149"|"statement"|"statement"|"I mean it definitely isn't the best burrito I've ever had but it'll do since my Mexican food standards in S'pore (that's what the cool people who live hear call it) are pretty low."
"2150"|"statement"|"statement"|"The texture wasn't what i expected."
"2151"|"statement"|"statement"|"a pair of scissors magically appeared when they saw that we were struggling to cut them udon with fork and spoon."
"2152"|"statement"|"statement"|"No wonder the place is half empty when we settled our check at 1pm on a weekend."
"2153"|"statement"|"statement"|"Meeting up a couple of friends there for the first time, the place was mostly filled with people who were enjoying a quick pre-dinner drink or just getting started to get sloshed with alcohol."
"2154"|"statement"|"statement"|"So where I would normally give a 2 I give this place a four."
"2155"|"statement"|"statement"|"Excellent ambience, just what I was in the mood for this evening."
"2156"|"statement"|"statement"|"Final verdict: I'd only come here when I crave for exotic breakfasts during dinner, other than that, not really worth the high price."
"2157"|"statement"|"statement"|"This place is very popular with tourists and locals  who love to try their famous xiao long bao and guo tie."
"2158"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've been to many Subway outlets where you could tell the staff could care less."
"2159"|"statement"|"statement"|"There were a couple small tables outside (both occupied) and what seemed like no vacancy inside."
"2160"|"statement"|"statement"|"Another suggestion I have is, when in doubt at what to eat, follow the locals and see where they line up or what the majority of the people are eating."
"2161"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm so happy there's a cute and happy cafe in Singapore where the food tastes amazing and looks so novel!!"
"2162"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"When I go to a vegetarian restaurant, you know what I want to eat?"
"2163"|"statement"|"statement"|"As other advised, we told staff to remove peanuts, and yet we were still charged for the ice tea that we never order (they promptly took it off the bill when I said something)."
"2164"|"statement"|"statement"|"Everything was deep fried to a point where that's all you could taste."
"2165"|"statement"|"statement"|"But there was one waiter who was very on the ball."
"2166"|"statement"|"statement"|"There had already been a line when I passed earlier, and there still was one when we arrived."
"2167"|"statement"|"statement"|"There was a long queue when we arrived and we were patient enough to wait outside."
"2168"|"statement"|"statement"|"Aburi Salmon Sushi ($15++) Torched Salmon Pressed Sushi with Mayonnaise When the dish was served, I was surprised by the huge chunk of rice."
"2169"|"statement"|"statement"|"Putting aside the question of why so many people can have a sit-down breakfast during normal working hours on a weekday, I am curious about Sarnies' breakfast offerings."
"2170"|"statement"|"statement"|"You find a very nondescript corner of a building with a sign that says to go in through the back of the building where you walk in to what looks like a small tunnel."
"2171"|"statement"|"statement"|"So one day when my girl friend asked where we should go for dinner I decided to be adventurous and suggested Baja Fresh which I've heard and seen before!"
"2172"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was very busy and loud when we were there."
"2173"|"statement"|"statement"|"They were quick to attend to us and ask us what else we would like to order, how is our food,  are we enjoying ourselves etc."
"2174"|"statement"|"statement"|"Popped in some time ago when I was in the area and needed to kill time waiting for someone nearby."
"2175"|"statement"|"statement"|"I can't remember what it's called but it was average - 3 stars."
"2176"|"statement"|"statement"|"The taste when put into your mouth is like a burst of celebration."
"2177"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't know if I would necessarily go that far, but I think you should realize that for the most part this is a tourist thing...but sometimes, it's fun to play tourist, as long as you know what you're getting into."
"2178"|"statement"|"statement"|"Now that is what I call a good vindaloo."
"2179"|"statement"|"statement"|"There was a Q when we arrived but the turnaround is extremely quick so we only waited a few minutes to get a table."
"2180"|"question"|"question"|"The environment here is gritty, but what better way to eat innards in soup?"
"2181"|"statement"|"statement"|"A fantastic hipster joint for those who have a few more dollars to spare."
"2182"|"statement"|"statement"|"In a place where I find it tough to find much meat, this is a sure stop to get yourself a hefty bratwurst."
"2183"|"statement"|"statement"|"Closed one's eyes, it was like butter popcorn which one usually have when watching movies, with popping effect in the mouth."
"2184"|"statement"|"statement"|"The parathas were decent but not what we wanted."
"2185"|"statement"|"statement"|"I bought a little extra as well to treat two Filipino friends who didn't believe that Jollibee was in Singapore."
"2186"|"statement"|"statement"|"Also, the only place I know where you can have green beer year round, as opposed to only on St. Paddy's day."
"2187"|"statement"|"statement"|"I only knew I had to pay extra for the drink when I was making payment."
"2188"|"statement"|"statement"|"Rich but not overpowering, Ju managed to ensure that the pasta was still kept Al Dente even when it's soaked in the creamy prawn sauce."
"2189"|"statement"|"statement"|"Definitely have a walk around first to see what stalls interest you before looking for a table."
"2190"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have a friend who once told me that she would always have a couple of servings of the bread from a French restaurant that she used to frequent because the bread was heavenly good, not to mention the memorable multi-course dinner."
"2191"|"statement"|"statement"|"You can also request for just ice cream in a cup which was what we did."
"2192"|"statement"|"statement"|"The service also a lot better when the place much quieter."
"2193"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were under the impression that we had 90 mins for the lunch buffet and the guy who seated us didn't mention it either."
"2194"|"statement"|"statement"|"So after a quick gander at their menu - you'll get what I mean when I said 'spiffed up'."
"2195"|"statement"|"statement"|"I always had some cravings when I came back to Asia."
"2196"|"statement"|"statement"|"The had a $10 menu that we ordered from and then when we got the bill they charged us regular price."
"2197"|"statement"|"statement"|"I ordered the seafood linguini which took a bit to come out and when you're hungry, it seemed as forever!"
"2198"|"statement"|"statement"|"chicken rice is not the best food "
"2199"|"statement"|"statement"|"My favourite thing to order and share when I'm super ravenous is the special paper masala thosai - a huge crispy thosai with delicious potatoes inside."
"2200"|"statement"|"statement"|"Nonetheless when the food started rolling into the table, we were pretty impressed."
"2201"|"statement"|"statement"|"I find it not cheap when comparing to Mexican food in the US but for Singapore standards I find it reasonable for what you get, especially considering the location."
"2202"|"statement"|"statement"|"I always appreciate cafes or restaurants who cater to smokers."
"2203"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were really glad when Peperoni Pizzeria opened up a branch in our neck of the woods as Greenwood Ave and Binjai, their earlier outlets were a bit out of the way for us."
"2204"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was really tough and nothing like what is expected of food that is slow cooked."
"2205"|"statement"|"statement"|"Location tip: they are in a rather hidden spot in the basement where Gong Cha used to be."
"2206"|"statement"|"statement"|"Yet Con is one of those places where it feels and LOOKS as if it was a place your parents went on dates at."
"2207"|"question"|"question"|"Also, who throughs on top St. Louis Ribs Dry Rub a Sauce?"
"2208"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is what defines millennial friendship- spending money for access to a power outlet."
"2209"|"statement"|"statement"|"But all things cannot be achieved without a sophisticated rearing process in the case of swine production, especially when the legendary Iberian pig becomes the spotlight and well sought after by the culinary kitchen."
"2210"|"statement"|"statement"|"and hot (thanks, Equator) so I couldn't help but question why he is taking me to a place that was serving hot Chinese soup."
"2211"|"statement"|"statement"|"The soft egg was not even center, so the lucky person who got that slice was the only one who had a chance to taste it."
"2212"|"statement"|"statement"|"but I'd set your expectations accordingly, i.e., you come here for a special occasion when you can sit by the window, but not for the highest level of fine dining or value"
"2213"|"statement"|"statement"|"Up next is the sea urchin pudding where everyone polished up the small cup-like pudding almost immediately."
"2214"|"statement"|"statement"|"I just try not to breathe when she has that one."
"2215"|"statement"|"statement"|"that I would like to try if I ever go back, that is when I crave for Korean fried chicken once in a blue moon."
"2216"|"statement"|"statement"|"A curler noodle is used when the stock is light, allowing the noodles the trap the soup while eating."
"2217"|"statement"|"statement"|"I kind of get why Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles has its loyal following."
"2218"|"statement"|"statement"|"But, go with the oden, at least that's what I assuage myself with cos' it's healthy and guilt-free."
"2219"|"statement"|"statement"|"I highly recommend it to those who like pork noodle."
"2220"|"question"|"question"|"Do not know where to go for supper?"
"2221"|"statement"|"statement"|"I used to go to RealFood when I was working around the area and I always end up regretting it because of the long waiting time."
"2222"|"statement"|"statement"|"What I mean is that sometimes when I go dressed casually I get looks, and sometimes I don't."
"2223"|"statement"|"statement"|"To be honest, I've resigned myself to not taking photos and keeping track of courses when it comes to omakase experiences because I get so lost amongst the items, so overwhelmed by the excellence of everything."
"2224"|"statement"|"statement"|"BUT, I can understand why this place would appeal to some."
"2225"|"question"|"question"|"So what does that mean per se?"
"2226"|"statement"|"statement"|"I didn't know what to expect, reading it was hakata style, but was pleasantly surprised, especially knowing I was trying ramen out in a mall (which in the US, is usually a recipe for a blech kind of ramen experience)."
"2227"|"statement"|"statement"|"Best come during holiday when there is no office crowd."
"2228"|"question"|"question"|"I sat back down and shortly afterwards two guys, who had occupied the table in front of mine and had been eating, got up and walked past me, when one of them stopped and said he wanted to apologise for the slow service but they wanted to get the coffees out quickly..  Again: Heh??"
"2229"|"question"|"question"|"Everyone at the table got into a state of nirvana and who was to say the dessert was no good?"
"2230"|"statement"|"statement"|"I thoroughly enjoyed pigging out at Chiso Zanmai and again for $15, just an absolute bargain when you consider an ala carte lunch coming out around the same price."
"2231"|"statement"|"statement"|"The way their staff made me feel was probably the way Julia Roberts character in Pretty Woman felt when she tried to purchase clothing on Rodeo Drive, and I look/act nothing like a trashy hooker."
"2232"|"statement"|"statement"|"I stopped in here yesterday at lunchtime when things were rather quiet so I got my choice of table right away."
"2233"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is one of the better hotels in Singapore where I occasionally stay or book clients into."
"2234"|"statement"|"statement"|"Cons:  1) The salted eggs toast was not what I was expecting."
"2235"|"statement"|"statement"|"On the whole, I enjoyed the brisk service although it was rather annoying when they kept coming over to ask if we're done when we were eating rather slowly."
"2236"|"statement"|"statement"|"but never actually visited until last saturday when we were looking for a place for post dinner drinks, Bincho comes to mind."
"2237"|"statement"|"statement"|"We had a reservation at 7.30 and when we reached the place at 7.40, it was about half full."
"2238"|"statement"|"statement"|"Set in a conservation shophouse, the front houses a bar where you can have drinks and there is a good wine list."
"2239"|"statement"|"statement"|"Located near the ION Food Opera, this crammed place is filled with patrons who are all in a state of peace because the desserts are out of this world delicious."
"2240"|"statement"|"statement"|"I honestly think the smell adds so much to what Kenny Rogers used to be."
"2241"|"statement"|"statement"|"At Waku Ghin, you will get seated at a counter where a chef comes out to serve 10-course degustation menu, priced at whopping S$400 per person (thank god the dollar to Singapore dollar exchange rate during my visit was as favorable as it could get!)."
"2242"|"statement"|"statement"|"They speak fluent cantonese and limited english but good enough to understand if you have any visitors or caucasian friend who cant understand mandarin or cantonese."
"2243"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was a pretty cool afternoon when I came by for some lunch, so the seats outdoors where actually a feasible option made easier when you find seats within the reach of the fan."
"2244"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was a few weeks back so don't remember exactly what we had or I'd say more, next time back will update this review or add another."
"2245"|"statement"|"statement"|"I agree with Andrea that the GYGs in Australia must be much better as I was pleasantly surprised when I tried them in Perth and Sydney."
"2246"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was actually disappointed when i had my first bite of the matcha strawberryfield waffle."
"2247"|"question"|"question"|"I am just curious what people like to eat here and what make this place so busy?"
"2248"|"statement"|"statement"|"Another 5, 6 different of kinds of ice-cream, macha (green tea) is not even up to the bar...and it was squeezed in a corner when there's always a line and right beside someone having their meals."
"2249"|"statement"|"statement"|"Potential meaning when she asked to heat it up , she microwaved it rather than the proper reheating machine which maybe the crumble dessert is a a mush dessert."
"2250"|"statement"|"statement"|"The best part about this place is that it's both tasty & cheap which can often be challenging in Singapore when on a budget."
"2251"|"statement"|"statement"|"2) Eel first course which wasn't prepared like what we were expecting (unagi style) but done extremely nicely and beautifully with garnishes that looked like an artwork but each of them carrying a punch of flavor."
"2252"|"statement"|"statement"|"The juice is also quite nice and the ladies behind the counter know what they're doing with coffee."
"2253"|"statement"|"statement"|"The slices were nice and thick for $20, slightly more than what I would usually pay for a Don at the usual Japanese chains like Sushi Tei, but there was definitely no compromise on quality!"
"2254"|"statement"|"statement"|"The service was excellent too as they checked on the customers' needs quickly when customers raised their hands."
"2255"|"statement"|"statement"|"Don't forget to order this dish when you visit."
"2256"|"statement"|"statement"|"definitely going to try to mimic their cold brew when I get home."
"2257"|"statement"|"statement"|"I wish they did more marketing, or maybe it's good that they didn't, because when I started to hear friends excitedly discuss the burgers and desserts here I was intrigued enough to go check it out."
"2258"|"statement"|"statement"|"Some nice outdoor roadside seats where u can enjoy your food while people watching."
"2259"|"question"|"question"|"Any idea where she moved with the closure or Ghim Moh for renovation?"
"2260"|"statement"|"statement"|"$3.68USD  What you see: The look of people walking up to the line as it progresses around multiple bends is worth walking by even if you don't stop."
"2261"|"statement"|"statement"|"We visited the Bao Makers on the last day of our holiday when we were quite full from our previous dinner, but at the back of my mind I always remembered my conversation with Em that I'd go and try the bao at this place."
"2262"|"statement"|"statement"|"Don't be sucked in by the celebrity name, the food is far from what the price tag leads you to expect."
"2263"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"Most of the stalls closed down early on weekdays and it was quiet when we were there and it was not even that late?"
"2264"|"statement"|"statement"|"After coming back from my medical mission trip in Yangon, back in May 2015, I was wondering where I could find Burmese food and I was told about this place through the Burmese people I came across and of course Yelp."
"2265"|"statement"|"statement"|"But what keeps me coming back here is their uniquely delicious grilled bacon!"
"2266"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was disappointed that the caramel ice cream was already melted when served."
"2267"|"statement"|"statement"|"This place is getting more and more crowded....   You are actually spoilt for choice when wanting a cuppa coffee in Tiong Bahru."
"2268"|"statement"|"statement"|"In Singapore this kind of food of course includes hainanese chicken rice which you might find at least one stall in any hawker center across Singapore and that's why it is easy to just pass on as another Hainanese chicken rice stall and people will not care about it being perfect or more."
"2269"|"statement"|"statement"|"The chee chong fun are made on the spot when you order, and it is like those served in HK dimsum restaurants."
"2270"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you're not sure what to pair your cheeses with, don't fret."
"2271"|"statement"|"statement"|"I assume it was the best of what they had to offer that day."
"2272"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just that when it's coupled with my fried food and chilli sauce, it finishes too quickly for me to savour it."
"2273"|"statement"|"statement"|"It got noisy when packed and you could hardly hear yourself think."
"2274"|"statement"|"statement"|"Coming from a country where vegies are fresh and readily available it's always been a struggle to find the equivalent in Singapore."
"2275"|"statement"|"statement"|"salad is love, salad is life "
"2276"|"statement"|"statement"|"The signature roast chicken with the spinach and mushroom chardonnay sauce flirted with being too rich which is perhaps what makes it satisfying."
"2277"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is one of many place along the water at Robertson Quay and I know what you are thinking - yet another place that is just over-priced and does not really deliver nearly what one would expect."
"2278"|"statement"|"statement"|"My spot near the beer coolers wobbled a bit when people walked near my table."
"2279"|"statement"|"statement"|"Unfortunately, this stall has been randomly closed on different days in the past year, and when it is open, it is a long wait to get your food, walk up, get your order on the list, and sit waiting for your food to come out."
"2280"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't get why this place has mediocre reviews."
"2281"|"statement"|"statement"|"The same standards apply to the restaurants as well and i was fortunate to experience what fine Cantonese dining means at the award winning Yan Ting."
"2282"|"statement"|"statement"|"I prefer the Clarke Quay location as it close to home but novena and Clarke Quay are located in the basement of the mall where traditional food courts are located - this makes a healthier option where there is often none in this type of set up."
"2283"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was lost in indecision and the girl helpfully offered to put on what she suggested would go with each meat."
"2284"|"statement"|"statement"|"The dish comes boiling and the ingredients are already cooked when it's presented at the table."
"2285"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even my toddler who loves guzzling plain, uncooked pasta rejected it."
"2286"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure why he wanted to wait on me as he was surly and clearly I was a hindrance."
"2287"|"statement"|"statement"|"I thrive on atmosphere where everyone joins in with the band and sings."
"2288"|"statement"|"statement"|"After queueing a good 15 minutes for ice-cream, I just want to sit down and enjoy it, not stand or walk around, waiting to get bumped and then drop that precious scoop (you've all scene the sad kidfaces when you drop food)."
"2289"|"statement"|"statement"|"Attempted further to break the pastry into the chowder - who knows, may absorb what is left and may make good the pastry."
"2290"|"statement"|"statement"|"It takes me back to the ones in Korea.I don't even know why real KFC or Popeye's exist when you can have this chicken."
"2291"|"statement"|"statement"|"A 3-course is priced at $38++ while you may go for a Luncheon Discovery menu which offers a 5-course at $88++ when you have a more generous lunch hour."
"2292"|"statement"|"statement"|"Arrived at 7:45PM, we registered on the waiting list for 2 pax, we were told they call us back in 15 to 30 minutes...so requested for a bar where to go for a drink...the girl was not able to tell us where to go."
"2293"|"statement"|"statement"|"And when I say big, I mean BIG big."
"2294"|"statement"|"statement"|"As a restaurant they have few tables outside where they serve an interesting menu."
"2295"|"statement"|"statement"|"As the place filled up, one table got served their food immediately since they where friends with the owner while the rest of us had to wait."
"2296"|"statement"|"statement"|"That are not cheap but you get what you pay for and nothing is lacking here."
"2297"|"statement"|"statement"|"sometimes i feel like a plastic bag "
"2298"|"statement"|"statement"|"To be charged $23 for a kebab rice dish like this, personally it's a nope for me and I would rather try it elsewhere where you get QUALITY kebab for that amount :)   Ok so we heard some reviews about their iced mint tea and had to try it."
"2299"|"statement"|"statement"|"According to my cousin, this is probably the only place in Singapore where you're allowed to litter, so enjoy cracking those peanuts and knocking those shells on the floor!"
"2300"|"statement"|"statement"|"It came medium when I ordered medium rare and overall was ok, nothing special."
"2301"|"question"|"question"|"(Come on yelp, where is my mexi-can badge?)"
"2302"|"statement"|"statement"|"We always go with someone who speaks mandarin as don't think much English is spoken."
"2303"|"statement"|"statement"|"My finger hovered over the mouse clicker for what felt like an eternity before I clicked on four."
"2304"|"question"|"question"|"Food was meh, pretty alright, the hamburger steak they made was pretty good (needed more salt), and they are pretty filling (well they are almost 100% carbs - what do you expect?)."
"2305"|"question"|"question"|"Will you still love me When I've got nothing but my aching soul?"
"2306"|"question"|"question"|"For example, where can you find pisang goreng anywhere near the centre these days?"
"2307"|"statement"|"statement"|"I haven't tried the food yet but from what I could see of the people around me, it looked pretty good."
"2308"|"statement"|"statement"|"Thankfully I had my fiance who spoke the language to order and pay."
"2309"|"statement"|"statement"|"But for me, I think they chicken does not taste particularly outstanding, and the sauces on the table actually tastes better and are more flavorful than what is used to marinate the chicken."
"2310"|"statement"|"statement"|"- Highly recommended for a date where both parties just wanna eat."
"2311"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you've ever wanted to know what wholesome felt like, getting the Barbacoa Pork tacos or burrito will give you that experience on your tastebuds."
"2312"|"statement"|"statement"|"My friend took me here to eat what she termed 'high class wanton noodle'."
"2313"|"statement"|"statement"|"Couldn't remember what to order for dinner."
"2314"|"statement"|"statement"|"This place is just a feel good place where you can talk as loud as you can while eating a good, greasy, cheap prata like it's supposed to be made."
"2315"|"statement"|"statement"|"Will be back again when the tummy or occasion calls!"
"2316"|"statement"|"statement"|"Drinks are on par with other top bars in town overpriced put together by mediocre bar tenders - come on folks take some pride in your work when you're charging so much."
"2317"|"statement"|"statement"|"I do not know what to justify the 10% service charge."
"2318"|"statement"|"statement"|"And like what Melissa Y wrote, the decor is almost like a carbon copy of Stateland Cafe."
"2319"|"statement"|"statement"|"So I asked and this is what they explained to me."
"2320"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure what the weekend scene is like."
"2321"|"statement"|"statement"|"That being said, Spize is an absolute post-clubbing institution and there are few better places when hammered."
"2322"|"statement"|"statement"|"2 stars for the friendly staff who were good."
"2323"|"statement"|"statement"|"We also ordered the croquttes, which bursted of flavour when we sunk our teeth into it."
"2324"|"statement"|"statement"|"Chicken and Rice is what they're obviously famous for."
"2325"|"statement"|"statement"|"We received a call when our table was ready and were greeted by a friendly gentleman apologizing for how crazy it was, but we weren't concerned at all because it was a holiday weekend."
"2326"|"statement"|"statement"|"Muscle memory I guess, you just remember where you left your fork, water/wine glass, etc."
"2327"|"statement"|"statement"|"My friends and I could not decide what to eat and made our choice the typical Singaporean way - by heading for the stall with the longest queue at Tai Wah Pork Noodles  There was a queue of at least 7 people in front of us when we started queueing and the wait was long (and excruciating since we were all rather starved)."
"2328"|"statement"|"statement"|"The soup is made even tastier when I drizzle their chili sauce in it."
"2329"|"statement"|"statement"|"I decided on the set menu as it has what I want and is easier to manage, instead of poring through the menu and wondering what to order."
"2330"|"statement"|"statement"|"The upstairs is decorated in a slight Shanghai theme, with posters of an old Chinese movie star called May Wong (yeah, no idea who she is either) covering most of the walls."
"2331"|"statement"|"statement"|"Upon going into the restaurant, you will be given a card that will be used to swipe the food or beverages you choose from the different sections and pay when you are about to exit the restaurant."
"2332"|"statement"|"statement"|"The bread was served fresh and fluffy and tasted delightful when dipped in Hummus, which is basically mashed chickpeas with spices."
"2333"|"statement"|"statement"|"Oh and that char siew that's already on your table when you're seated... it's just sublime."
"2334"|"statement"|"statement"|"But when they take 45mins to bring you your shisha, that's kinda a deal breaker."
"2335"|"statement"|"statement"|"But was not opened when we reach at 645pm."
"2336"|"statement"|"statement"|"They close at 3 on weekdays, but usually when the hawker crowd becomes scarce, they will start packing by 2, so you need to be there before 2!"
"2337"|"statement"|"statement"|"That was when I knew this was going to be an experience to remember."
"2338"|"statement"|"statement"|"I came here one morning when I arrived early for a morning meeting in the area, and decided to give this place a go."
"2339"|"statement"|"statement"|"That is where the charm begins and ends."
"2340"|"statement"|"statement"|"The service made up for some of the disappointments but the straw that broke the camel's back was when our friend who orders the fish and chips was asked to order something else and then didn't receive her food until well after we had finished our meals."
"2341"|"statement"|"statement"|"The food wasn't exactly stellar, but certainly more authentic than what many pseudo Japanese restaurants offer on Orchard."
"2342"|"statement"|"statement"|"The bouillabaisse is well known to be a signature of Chef Francois, who came up with his own version when he was unable to find one he really liked."
"2343"|"statement"|"statement"|"They made all of the drinks that I asked and I also learned about a new drink from one of the people I was sitting next too who told me about something called the perfect martins."
"2344"|"statement"|"statement"|"Thanks to a friend who had some free time and was willing to wait in line for the better part of the hour, we were brought to our table shortly after our arrival."
"2345"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't know what they add in that creamy dressing, it was just delicious."
"2346"|"statement"|"statement"|"With fusion cuisine having the tendency of trying too hard, I think many are often disappointed with what is offered."
"2347"|"statement"|"statement"|"There are so many types of fruits and vegetables available that I wonder if it also caters to those who have brought their own juicers to the office to make their own drink."
"2348"|"statement"|"statement"|"Their food is alright but maybe it's better to come on weekdays when it is less crowded."
"2349"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure what the rave is about."
"2350"|"statement"|"statement"|"If this isn't a win, I don't know what is."
"2351"|"statement"|"statement"|"instead what you see is jewel, shining bright like a diamond, next door."
"2352"|"statement"|"statement"|"don't be alarmed when the small curtain by the side of your table gets lifted up, the food is delivered through the little window there."
"2353"|"statement"|"statement"|"But when it comes to Palais, like I said - you'd be better off sticking to late night drinks and desserts."
"2354"|"statement"|"statement"|"But I was lucky to be brought here by a friend who knows the chef well and we enjoyed a Christmas dinner here."
"2355"|"statement"|"statement"|"Sometimes owners just need to remember function when they are trying hard to be cool."
"2356"|"statement"|"statement"|"So when I went to this cafe for the first time, it brought back some good memories."
"2357"|"statement"|"statement"|"Based on flavor alone, I see no reasonable explanation why not...unless it's the bull-@#$% these places are throwing in your eyes."
"2358"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've never been much of a fan of paying much money for, well, what is essentially flour (all you bakers - hold your pitchforks!"
"2359"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have passed by several times when I visited Objectifs next door and the restaurant space always looks a bit crammed so I assume it was mostly outdoors."
"2360"|"statement"|"statement"|"Unfortunately though, the person who prepared the oysters simply did not know how to shuck an oyster."
"2361"|"statement"|"statement"|"It cost me about $8 for what i ordered, the quality of the dish made it worth it, but i was not expecting such a price from a hawker centre (not so much if it was at a food court)."
"2362"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's hard not to taste the awesomeness of the fish, or see the value in what you're getting."
"2363"|"statement"|"statement"|"Yet sometimes a Teriyaki chicken sandwich is what I want and need and so Mos Cafe it is."
"2364"|"statement"|"statement"|"If one refers to the absolute price of the food, I think its a foregone conclusion when eating fine dining anything."
"2365"|"statement"|"statement"|"Best still, if you're looking to try or go by glasses, opt for their wine dispenser where you can choose from trying portion to full glass options to keep yourself intoxicated."
"2366"|"statement"|"statement"|"http://tinyurl.com/azdxbho  Corn fed Spatchcock, Cajun and herb spices - I am not quite sure what made this dish a spatchcock, a cooking term for removing the main two bones and cooking the chicken flat."
"2367"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Bee Hoon and the Char Kway Teow are decent, especially late at night when you are trying to find something to hold you over after a night of drinking."
"2368"|"statement"|"statement"|"Also who can forget -  sheesha!"
"2369"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm sorry but when it takes your 3 and a half hours to delivery something then thats just a failure and any good establishment will try and make it up to the customer."
"2370"|"statement"|"statement"|"Food here is reasonably priced, and I would say a meal here would cost you about $50 and above per pax, depending on what you order."
"2371"|"statement"|"statement"|"Where else can you find a chicken rice set for Sg$5 and fried kuey teow for Sg$3, just to give you a preview of what you'll be charged."
"2372"|"statement"|"statement"|"I really hate saying lukewarm things about people who make the effort to put food in front of me, it is after all, a deliberate and likely carefully considered act and"
"2373"|"statement"|"statement"|"the pork rib is not super tender, but it's good enough, and easily overlooked when considering how damn good their broth is."
"2374"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't know why Les Bouchons has all the hype when this place clearly has it beat down!!!"
"2375"|"statement"|"statement"|"They do have after 6 specials too where fresh short cakes are sold at 20% discount."
"2376"|"question"|"question"|"But where can you find such reminiscence in this present day?"
"2377"|"statement"|"statement"|"which - I suspect - is where this place was heading for, but I'm not sure it succeeded."
"2378"|"statement"|"statement"|"This will be a recommendation and go to place when you want to have a Chinese feast and want them to be perfectly cooked and delicious."
"2379"|"statement"|"statement"|"On the downside, I noticed the servers often DO NOT use gloves when serving and dishing the food -- not only is this kinda disgusting but it's a health hazard."
"2380"|"statement"|"statement"|"First, the service is very bad: server had no idea what the dishes included (do they include cheese, do they come with bread); the dishes were served one, then two, then the last one came after the first three finished eating."
"2381"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even when we asked for the bill it didn't occur to server to ask if we wanted coffee ."
"2382"|"statement"|"statement"|"There's about 3 waiters they Kept coming asking what we ordered."
"2383"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not what I was expecting - the pudding was topped with what I can only describe as date-flavored jello."
"2384"|"statement"|"statement"|"I kinda knew what I was going to get into."
"2385"|"question"|"question"|"Remember the movie Liar Liar when the truth always explosively erupts out of Jim Carrey's mouth, often to devastating effect?"
"2386"|"statement"|"statement"|"The feeling of a returning patron is always forward looking because I knew what to expect from the famed Tsukada Nojo under the AP Company."
"2387"|"statement"|"statement"|"I knew this was going to be a interesting meal when I saw the fun front door."
"2388"|"statement"|"statement"|"A haiku- didn't know what to  eat on Sunday afternoon for Fat Cow was closed  A well-known Singapore food blogger had proclaimed that this was one of the top 5 restaurants in Singapore this year - big shoes to fill considering that we're home to some of the worlds' best places like Andre and Iggy's."
"2389"|"statement"|"statement"|"Nice idea to make the whole experience faster: you'll be given a bracelet that you scan when you order on any ramen counter that you choose and drink counter, give the bracelet later to the cashier to find out your total."
"2390"|"statement"|"statement"|"the good thing was that we had chirpy waiters dishing up our food - but we had to be chased out after barely two hours of a long many-coursed dinner (such is the quirk of trendy, busy restaurants), and they refused to bring me a glass of water when I first walked in (IT'S SELF-SERVICE, PLEASE) even though there was no one else in the restaurant and the waiters were milling about."
"2391"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm not sure what Bourdain was on when he had this."
"2392"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service was attentive & quick, including the owner who was really hospitable."
"2393"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have to admit we didn't really know what we were eating."
"2394"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"Noodles when I can have bratwurst?)"
"2395"|"statement"|"statement"|"Ok (writes down 30)  Unfortunately, while funny when reading, experiencing this makes a guest rather uncomfortable."
"2396"|"statement"|"statement"|"They used to have a menu that is pretty similar to the taiwan chain but they took out the menu and what ever you can find on the belt  would be the all the food they serve."
"2397"|"statement"|"statement"|"The salmon is torched so this dish is suitable for diners who are not into raw food."
"2398"|"question"|"question"|"Well, well, well... What can I say?"
"2399"|"statement"|"statement"|"I suppose when things get this commercialized, you lose the charm and personality that you once had."
"2400"|"statement"|"statement"|"They should consider putting ENG or something when the menu was in Chinese mode and in Chinese characters when in English mode so the monolingual can select the language option."
"2401"|"statement"|"statement"|"Given it's random location, getting to the restaurant can be challenging if you don't know where you need to go (it felt like we were parking in some old industrial estate then wondering lost through an HDB estate), but once you get through to it, the restaurant glistens like a glass jewel box in the lush forest."
"2402"|"statement"|"statement"|"It also makes sense when you're trying to serve without disrupting a conversation."
"2403"|"statement"|"statement"|"Trust me when I say it's still pretty worth it."
"2404"|"statement"|"statement"|"Photo of sign with how the process works:  http://tinyurl.com/ko5tx3n  When you enter, you are given a magnetic card on a wristband."
"2405"|"statement"|"statement"|"My mum (who's a huge fan of oysters) said it's a pity she can't just walk into Andre and order 3-4 helpings of this when she feels like it."
"2406"|"statement"|"statement"|"Does anybody know what happened to the screaming uncle who ran the minced meat noodle/fishball soup/etc..."
"2407"|"statement"|"statement"|"Was joined by an australian who invited himself to sit with me who says he's only in Singapore 5 hours but comes to this restaurant every time he visits."
"2408"|"statement"|"statement"|"I discovered this place after searching the recommended bars in Singapore and I must say that it was not what I expected."
"2409"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was thrilled that they served gizzard shad (kohada) which is a favourite of mine, but the texture of the fish was a little softer than what I'm used to, which with a fish as strongly flavoured as kohada, made for a not 5-star sushi."
"2410"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is a must go to when in Singapore."
"2411"|"statement"|"statement"|"Overall, great spot for morning dim sum; wouldn't hesitate to come back when my stomach decides to cooperate!"
"2412"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is exactly what we did - popped out for a small burger during our clubbing experience."
"2413"|"statement"|"statement"|"We could see what the chefs were doing!"
"2414"|"statement"|"statement"|"We thought that the staff came on very strong when we sat down."
"2415"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm a sucker for deep fried food so hello croquetas - when I see something breaded, I'm thinking YES."
"2416"|"statement"|"statement"|"They did not provide much sauce too and when my meal was served, the sauce almost got dried up."
"2417"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm usually not a fan of tandori chicken b/c I think it's flavorless, but this one here was booming w/ a tasty flavor so now I kind of get what tandori is about."
"2418"|"statement"|"statement"|"Finally, have a catchy tagline that expains what in the world an Imbiss is or why this place is so spanking clean."
"2419"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had the luxury of strawberry shortcake not too long ago, when my colleagues decided that a birthday without a cake is not a birthday."
"2420"|"question"|"question"|"so what the hell, singapore?"
"2421"|"statement"|"statement"|"We assumed it would be significantly better than what we find in Gearhart, Oregon."
"2422"|"statement"|"statement"|"5 people behind the counter and the staff who helped with my order was quite efficient."
"2423"|"statement"|"statement"|"It is also the pick among a lot of people who frequents this place."
"2424"|"statement"|"statement"|"Due back here soon and I cannot wait and for those of you who doubt the quality.... try it sober."
"2425"|"statement"|"statement"|"Disappointing ending to what would been a nice break from walking around."
"2426"|"statement"|"statement"|"I love this section of Duxton Hill because it reminds me of Europe, what with the cobble-stoned road and lush trees lining each side of it."
"2427"|"statement"|"statement"|"Banchan : Gamja Jorim (Soy Braised Potatoes ) Myulchi Bokkeum (Stir-fried Anchovies) Kongnamul-muchim (Marinated Bean Sprouts) Kimchi   Not much choice when your dining partner refused to have anything spicy."
"2428"|"statement"|"statement"|"I highly approved of  their efficient take a number system, where they assign you a number and give you a menu to fill out while you wait."
"2429"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just remember to skip the miso soup they try to sell you when you first sit down because that is one fishy nasty soup."
"2430"|"statement"|"statement"|"Cozy up to the bar, order one of their signature sandwiches, test the bartender's knowledge with an off-menu cocktail and appreciate what all of Singapore (at least all of Singapore's ex-pats anyway) have already discovered."
"2431"|"statement"|"statement"|"But now, I guess who doesn't want extra business, THERE'S NO LIMIT to the number of cupcakes you can buy!"
"2432"|"statement"|"statement"|"So, I am not sure what the deal is."
"2433"|"statement"|"statement"|"So if you want quiet surroundings, forget about this place because you won't know when there will be a function."
"2434"|"statement"|"statement"|"When we later brought it up to the guy who was our waiter, his explanation was that the sirloin would have cooked even more as time passed."
"2435"|"statement"|"statement"|"Whilst they are open for dinner as well, my most frequented visits here occur during lunchtime where they have a special set of about 10-15 dishes that are reasonably priced at $8-$12 each on their lunch menu."
"2436"|"statement"|"statement"|"Everything else I've tried so far (including drinks) is so-so, so why bother when the prata is *this* good."
"2437"|"statement"|"statement"|"I loved it here and would absolutely go back, especially since they have lots of promos and reasonably priced food and drinks compared to most of what you'll find in Singapore."
"2438"|"statement"|"statement"|"Many good foreign restaurants who set up shop here, they just import a brand with a story from say, Japan that has quality and care and does the opposite while milking all it's worth here in Singapore."
"2439"|"statement"|"statement"|"I steal a bite when she's not looking, and BOOM."
"2440"|"statement"|"statement"|"The troubling items for KEK was that the atmosphere seemed cheap, especially in comparison to where business travelers normally end up."
"2441"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's not too spicy, where sweat is literally dripping down your face (happened to me at Jane Thai, haha!"
"2442"|"statement"|"statement"|"You could give it a try and let me know what you think though."
"2443"|"statement"|"statement"|"For those who does not appreciate sweetness in your salty foods, do not get it."
"2444"|"statement"|"statement"|"the staff seemed like a fun bunch; they were friendly and looked like people who enjoy their work at the cafe."
"2445"|"statement"|"statement"|"Had to add another $3 for this but I think it is worth it because I wanted to try escargots when ever it is available on the menu.Though I still prefer the garlic and herbs version of Le Entrec?te's,this one is not too bad either."
"2446"|"statement"|"statement"|"Yes, it's actually my husband who is a huge fan so I go with him, but the thing is dim sum here is great!"
"2447"|"statement"|"statement"|"I like to eat soon after buying though, as I find that the crust hardens quickly and it's not nice when it's no longer warm."
"2448"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service is always exceptional and the food is always just what it should be."
"2449"|"statement"|"statement"|"But the place was exactly what we were looking for."
"2450"|"statement"|"statement"|"Pizza and have been walking past the restaurant everyday, skeptical and all since, um, when you work in the doldrums known as Suntec City everything looks bad, overpriced or both."
"2451"|"statement"|"statement"|"Another thing that goes well for this place is that its an economy rice place so you can try it with other dishes and there is option of having the same curry with a fillet when you are dining alone."
"2452"|"statement"|"statement"|"During this time, I will with my son to the hawker center upstairs where we were to scope out the stall."
"2453"|"question"|"rhetoric"|"Usually when it's during quiet periods, people in general tend to just chat, shoot the breeze or go outside and smoke - which is fine when it's slow, eh?"
"2454"|"statement"|"statement"|"Alas, my first experience at Din Tai Fung, where they supposedly serve the best xiao long bao in the world!"
"2455"|"statement"|"statement"|"I also can't name all of what we were eating as they were just rather spicy, spice-y things that tasted decent (but how could it not, with that many aromatics) but a spicy chickpea curry had tender legumes and the raita was cool and delicious."
"2456"|"statement"|"statement"|"The only drawback was the ban chans do not have a good variety (5 wasn't impressive when you experienced 11 at other places!)."
"2457"|"statement"|"statement"|"Warning: For those who don't like added oil on your eggs, be sure to specify without;   I see it like pepper - don't put it on people's food unless you ask them first, mention it on the menu, and better yet, rather than serve it with, have it on the table for the customer to do for themselves."
"2458"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had my hopes up when i spotted Ricotta Hotcakes ($14) on the menu, only to have them dashed when i took the first bite."
"2459"|"statement"|"statement"|"But beef was extremely expensive when I looked at the grocery store, so with that in mind this is actually a bargain."
"2460"|"question"|"question"|"A few minutes later...guess what idea he comes back with?"
"2461"|"statement"|"statement"|"And I had split my bill with my roommate, who was also sitting in disbelief that the two of us would consume $120 worth of chili crab."
"2462"|"statement"|"statement"|"For dinner, he wanted Indian food so we thought where else can we go but Little India."
"2463"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just when you look up and think Heyy!!"
"2464"|"statement"|"statement"|"Sour Cream & Onion is another gift as well with powdery and rich sour cream that will sure to please anyone who adores this classic flavour."
"2465"|"statement"|"statement"|"Yes, tea and peanuts are not free, but what's a few dollars when the crab is so exorbitant."
"2466"|"statement"|"statement"|"There's probably like 20 Germans in Raffles Place (and they're all from DB) and 100s of everyone else who doesn't understand what a Malaysian-bird-sounding shop is (that's what I thought an imbiss was until I bothered to google it)."
"2467"|"statement"|"statement"|"Space is a little tight but the hustle and bustle about is actually what adds to the experience."
"2468"|"statement"|"statement"|"At the end of the meal, you are led downstairs to find out what each dish was and it's fun to talk about why you thought something was what it was (or wasn't) with other people you were eating with."
"2469"|"statement"|"statement"|"Insanely and unjustifiably expensive sushi restaurant clearly intended for those who are either on a business expense account or have won big at the tables at the Marina Bay Sands casino."
"2470"|"statement"|"statement"|"Waffles and dessert was what we came for."
"2471"|"statement"|"statement"|"Came here for the first time when my boss decided that it was time for breakfast and was instantly converted into a fan!"
"2472"|"statement"|"statement"|"But I don't think the right term for ventilation is what I just described."
"2473"|"statement"|"statement"|"There are many varieties of porridge available and it does see a steady stream of customer who usually get it to go."
"2474"|"statement"|"statement"|"Cauliflower 3 ways - $13  Another starter we had was great and perhaps suitable for those who want a lighter meal instead."
"2475"|"statement"|"statement"|"Reason being my reluctance at what I assumed was another company jumping on to the Ramen bandwagon."
"2476"|"statement"|"statement"|"I am 99% sure this is what people think when they look at the Bratworks shop and I don't understand why the owners swap out the fries in the damn picture and show some potato slaw or better yet, sauerkraut (hello fermented food movement!!)."
"2477"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'll be back to try the Crab Tsukemen a.k.a dipping noodles (I used to love Menya Musashi's tsukemen in black soup when the quality was still good)."
"2478"|"statement"|"statement"|"So when that server pass by I asked if she's okay."
"2479"|"statement"|"statement"|"Price: with tax a Singapore Sling comes to $36 -- not a huge deal, however what was disappointing was that this was the 1st cocktail I've had in 2 months (due to working in a dry country) and I did not even feel the slightest of anything from my 1 Singapore Sling.."
"2480"|"statement"|"statement"|"We like places where we can bring our laptops and stay for a few hours."
"2481"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is the one where the noodles and the soup come separate."
"2482"|"statement"|"statement"|"Good for days when you want to treat yourself or host guests!"
"2483"|"statement"|"statement"|"I thought my girlfriend and I were under-giving when we each left $10 for our dinner, but I've heard from a number of people who have visited Annalakshmi that this is an appropriate amount to give."
"2484"|"statement"|"statement"|"Before embarking on an art adventure at the Singapore Arts Museum, why don't you stop by the Dome Cafe."
"2485"|"statement"|"statement"|"The cold cuts and seafood are extremely fresh best eaten when paired with something from their extensive cheese cellar."
"2486"|"statement"|"statement"|"The soup was peppery instead of herbal which was what I had previously from a different location in Singapore."
"2487"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were a bit hungry after our 2 appetizers and 2 mains, so that's why I knock a star off."
"2488"|"statement"|"statement"|"Half an hour is too long to wait when all that needs to be cooked is bacon and eggs."
"2489"|"statement"|"statement"|"Yes, it was great that I get to eat Dim Sum at 5am when I was really craving for it, but to get all the way there, and being served with barely-considered-warm porridge, slightly below average dim sum, was seriously a damper."
"2490"|"statement"|"statement"|"yes that is true but it was actually tough when they first served it."
"2491"|"statement"|"statement"|"i only had their fuji sushi set but based on that and what the rest had from the conveyor belt, the quality is definitely there."
"2492"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is a must experience when in Singapore!"
"2493"|"statement"|"statement"|"Me, I knew this was the real deal when upon my being seated, I was immediately presented with a flask of iced water."
"2494"|"statement"|"statement"|"Long ago, when my mother was a little girl, she used to stay at one of the shop houses along Amoy Street."
"2495"|"statement"|"statement"|"Time was not what I had, so I made sure i ordered everything I wanted to try correctly the first time with absolutely no regrets."
"2496"|"statement"|"statement"|"The waitstaff were quick to replace it with a fresh one when I pointed it out to them."
"2497"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's a small, dingy (cosy, if it's not a full house), hole-in-a-wall in Orchard Plaza (above the various KTV lounges and Filipino hostesses), with a very much Japanese chef (who behaves like an extremely culinary-talented dad at home), and his Singaporean 'translator'/co-owner of the place who helps speak to the chef and to get orders."
"2498"|"statement"|"statement"|"Bouillabaisse seems like the perfect option and that was what I opted for."
"2499"|"statement"|"statement"|"Maybe I did not enjoy the subtleness of the 10 well-presented courses enough but honestly I was expecting to be wowed but in the end I came away with 3000 reasons why I could have eaten elsewhere for 5* food but much much better value."
"2500"|"statement"|"statement"|"We happened to be looking around for dinner at Plaza Singapura when we stumbled upon their Steamboat Buffet!"
"2501"|"statement"|"statement"|"2-3 staff took notes when we checked about the order status but nobody made any action on it."
"2502"|"statement"|"statement"|"Which is why Absinthe is great, because despite its lack of publicity and even a change of location, it has been doing good since i last wrote about it 2 years ago (read about it here)."
"2503"|"statement"|"statement"|"The menu changes everyday so check their website to see what they have for that day."
"2504"|"statement"|"statement"|"I asked our server what flavor this black colored macaron was, and he confirmed my suspicion."
"2505"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was disappointed by the 10 Oz of New York Strip Steak ($36.90) as well as the 10 Oz Slow Roasted and Seared Prime Rib ($37.90) as the texture were either too sinewy or too rare when we ordered the Medium Rare."
"2506"|"statement"|"statement"|"your recommendations dont suit me "
"2507"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's always a happy day when the market closes lower for the day (if you're not a trader) because Overeasy has a slider promotion where you can get these lovely mini burgers at  $1 each."
"2508"|"question"|"question"|"if i speak nicely to you, will you provide me with better recommendations? "
"2509"|"statement"|"statement"|"The place have only few tables where you can share a table with others if available."
"2510"|"statement"|"statement"|"Crispy Roasted Pork Belly $15++ *highly recommended* My friends who never tried this before were crazy over this dish."
"2511"|"statement"|"statement"|"The local audience being business people having meetings they do not care that much about what they are drinking - this isn't Tiong Bahru..."
"2512"|"statement"|"statement"|"The light hearted atmosphere made it very pleasant indeed, and it was clear why there'd be so many patrons sitting around and chatting after they had long finished their lunch."
"2513"|"statement"|"statement"|"Oh well...   First time here and not knowing what to order, my friend and I opted for the set lunch for 2 for $40."
"2514"|"statement"|"statement"|"Depending on my mood, i would go for Ten Cha Soba set ($12) when i want something lighter."
"2515"|"statement"|"statement"|"Mine were premade as they were not busy when I stopped by so they already had some waiting but they did taste very fresh."
"2516"|"statement"|"statement"|"And Ye Yint Cafe is a place where many gather."
"2517"|"statement"|"statement"|"The yam flavour from the Yam Milk Shake was very distinctive and a mixture with the yam ice-cream is a very fulfilling experience especially for people who like yam (like X and me)."
"2518"|"statement"|"statement"|"I guess this place will be great for people who are into authentic beer (which are always bitter)."
"2519"|"statement"|"statement"|"Its like $5+ SGD for 3 of them, which is a little pricey, even when translating to $USD but if you're here on vacation, might as well splurge a little lol."
"2520"|"statement"|"statement"|"We only found out when the bill came & we saw the prices."
"2521"|"statement"|"statement"|"I did not know this when looking for the place so it took me a while to find it."
"2522"|"statement"|"statement"|"I mean look, I am an Asian and brought up in a Chinese family where RICE is a staple."
"2523"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you don't know what to eat, sit down and share a table with the locals, they'll tell you what's good!"
"2524"|"statement"|"statement"|"His eyes lid up when we talked about wine and Spain."
"2525"|"statement"|"statement"|"Loving the way how this dish is prepared in the aluminum pack and slit open in front of us when being served on our table."
"2526"|"statement"|"statement"|"Entertained our very active little toddler who was getting restless during our lunch."
"2527"|"statement"|"statement"|"If youve been to lucha loco then you know what youre getting yourself into."
"2528"|"statement"|"statement"|"Our small setback is that we have to wait for quite sometime to be let up, i don't really get how they priortise who they will let up in the lift first, the longest we waited was about 30 mins just to get into the lift."
"2529"|"statement"|"statement"|"Definitely a dish I would order when I next return."
"2530"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you know what to expect, this is a good place to pop by for quick cheap eats."
"2531"|"statement"|"statement"|"I forgot what I ate due to food coma..."
"2532"|"question"|"question"|"It had more lettuce/greens than what I've had around Seattle but I liked it instead of the usual/authentic(?)"
"2533"|"statement"|"statement"|"2 - Waitress (different staff) tried to take a plate away when there was clearly food still on it."
"2534"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just tell Louis what you feel like drinking and he'll cook something up for you."
"2535"|"statement"|"statement"|"Aloo Gobi - I was slightly disappointed when I saw their it was quite dry with no sauce."
"2536"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service was great as we were served by Kirby who recommended everything."
"2537"|"statement"|"statement"|"I live down the street from here, so I cant believe this place has been open for over a month and i didn't notice... Until yesterday, when i happened to walk down this way after coming back from town."
"2538"|"statement"|"statement"|"Feel the labour crunch when I heard they r no longer offering own-cooked barley drink."
"2539"|"statement"|"statement"|"I know this place is probably better known for their chicken, butI come here about once a month when I'm craving some spicy Bawal Penyet."
"2540"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were understanding about the long wait until he gave our table to a group of Caucasians who walked in a good 45 minutes after us!!"
"2541"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm most likely to go when I'm meeting someone and they want a sweet drink or we need a comfy couch chair to catchup over."
"2542"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is their signature dish and when you try it, you understand why!!!"
"2543"|"statement"|"statement"|"An old lady who is in-charge of setting the chopsticks, spoon and sauce will be the first once you've set down, always smiling."
"2544"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service here was touch and go, and this is coming from someone who isn't normally picky with service, just food."
"2545"|"question"|"question"|"My friends had other things like chicken and what not but then again who orders chicken at a fish restaurant?"
"2546"|"statement"|"statement"|"The lights used are mainly spot lights at the area where the long tables are, thus it may also get a little warm."
"2547"|"statement"|"statement"|"Then, you would be able to dine on the exquisite seasonal French omakase that also changes daily, depending on what is fresh."
"2548"|"statement"|"statement"|"next time when i go there again and if i manage to either solve the rubix cube or fold a paper crane then I'll update this review."
"2549"|"statement"|"statement"|"But when I came again recently after Sunday brunch, I found that their service is consistently good and the beers are cheap for Singapore standards (S$ 5 for a half pint their house brews)."
"2550"|"question"|"question"|"You occupy one location as a kopi tiam for 75 years, hand down recipes, grill grease and oven char generation after generation, basically watch Keong Saik go from a dirty road of prostitution to Singapore's new it street while still continuing to pump out fast, cheap and flavorful dishes and some of the best kopi and kaya I've ever had, and then you get forced to up and move to a new spot and are expected to pick up right where you left off?"
"2551"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have to politely disagree with what most Yelpers have said about Oriole."
"2552"|"statement"|"statement"|"Smells Like Gin Spirit: I was hoping for a nice refreshing cocktail and that's exactly what I got."
"2553"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service was incredible, with the chef explaining what he was serving with its Japanese names (and English names upon request)."
"2554"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, when I tasted it, it is so hard and not crispy at all."
"2555"|"statement"|"statement"|"Ssikkek literally gives you the equivalent of what you could do at home for the same price."
"2556"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not sure why I would ever go back, if not for those yummy lime mint mocktails."
"2557"|"statement"|"statement"|"We only drank when we visited but the food looked and smelled delicious."
"2558"|"statement"|"statement"|"It really baffles me when the standard drops so much."
"2559"|"statement"|"statement"|"SUM: With so many nice caf?s in TP, this one isn't necessarily worth a visit unless a French ambiance is what you're seeking."
"2560"|"statement"|"statement"|"Jumbo is still my go-to restaurant for friends and family who are first-time visitors looking to try chili crab."
"2561"|"statement"|"statement"|"I knicked a slice or two of pork cheeks from my friends, who ordered the 'Choice Pork Ramen'."
"2562"|"statement"|"statement"|"But that's exactly where you'll find Esquina Tapas Bar."
"2563"|"question"|"question"|"Poor service (do I really need to repeatedly ask for water refills when the restaurant is half empty?)"
"2564"|"statement"|"statement"|"First up, when we first arrived, they did not have our reservation."
"2565"|"statement"|"statement"|"That might be what made it for me."
"2566"|"statement"|"statement"|"There's even a cobbler who has on more than one occasion helped me patched up my shoes."
"2567"|"statement"|"statement"|"In my opinion, this is where they're better than Founder's."
"2568"|"statement"|"statement"|"They've got a cute customer loyalty programme where you get a name card describing you as their assistant manager."
"2569"|"statement"|"statement"|"Although I have to confess when I first heard the name, I had honestly thought it was a new name of a bag brand or something."
"2570"|"question"|"question"|"it took me awhile to get a menu and then once i ordered a drink it took me 35 minutes to get our drinks (after i walked to the back and said where is my beer)?"
"2571"|"statement"|"statement"|"Though note that half the space is set up almost as if catered for the lone customer who wants to get some reading and work done, which is great."
"2572"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Cabernet Sauvignon was good for what it cost ($40)."
"2573"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was stumbling around looking for a food center near my hotel and all I could see where expensive touristy restaurants with American or overpriced Singaporean food."
"2574"|"statement"|"statement"|"That is exactly what happened at Bedrock."
"2575"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were there with our goggle map showing us that we were at the right spot, but looking around, we saw signboards of others except for this one and when we went closer for a look, we saw the signboard in small blackboard on a chair."
"2576"|"statement"|"statement"|"There was no English menu and I have no idea what anything is so I did what a desperate tourist did: point at what everyone else is eating."
"2577"|"statement"|"statement"|"One of the better Dim Sum places around Singapore, although it's not the best however it's pretty good and what makes it stand out is some of the more unique dishes that they offer."
"2578"|"statement"|"statement"|"The atmosphere in the restaurant is great for conversation, as it's hard to hear what your neighbour is chatting (kaypoh - busybody), so you won't have to worry about anyone eavesdropping."
"2579"|"statement"|"statement"|"Two of us have never touched alcohol before, so we asked one who had and she confirmed that the taste was exactly the same as a genuine champagne."
"2580"|"statement"|"statement"|"Indeed, this is one of the reasons (and probably the main reason) why I tend to frequent Humpback and other restaurants in the area more often than Neon Pigeon."
"2581"|"statement"|"statement"|"Food:  Okay, so I'm probably a newbie compared to everyone in Singapore when it comes to Indian food, but honestly this has to be one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Singapore."
"2582"|"statement"|"statement"|"Everything was terribly disappointing and nothing like what I remembered having before."
"2583"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was still surprised when I came upon a Costa Rican hawker stall."
"2584"|"statement"|"statement"|"Even when the soup is too peppery for me, I had my soup refilled once."
"2585"|"statement"|"statement"|"Their baguette's the best I've had so far in Singapore - easily a five star rating, but what brought it down is the below average crowd control (which can easily be explained by the craze caused by word-of-mouth and being in the Straits Times!)."
"2586"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Verdict:  With so many other similar restaurants, it's hard to put into words what makes this one stand out."
"2587"|"statement"|"statement"|"The seafood itself was fresh - I liked the uni and what looked and tasted like hokkigai - but it was let down by the rice and overly mild soy sauces brushed on."
"2588"|"statement"|"statement"|"Quality still as good as ever, but the portion sizes have shrunk so much it's almost funny - when I saw the size of the puo luo bao after 2 years overseas, I had a double take."
"2589"|"statement"|"statement"|"Could not taste the mayo in it, but the patty was surprisingly good, even when it was minced very finely."
"2590"|"statement"|"statement"|"The outlet was known for its Crab stock ramen which did not sit well with Singaporeans who assoicated it with the local prawn noodle soup."
"2591"|"statement"|"statement"|"Then had a shooter that was incredible but don't know what it was."
"2592"|"statement"|"statement"|"When I asked them what time they closed, they were like 1-2am, or even 4am on weekends."
"2593"|"statement"|"statement"|"Servers came over to check on our needs pretty fast and they are understanding especially when we took awhile before coming to a conclusion on what to get - all american breakfast and toast set."
"2594"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's still a good meeting spot if you're in this area, though, but these days I would rather go to Brotzeit right across where I know I can get beer and okay stuff overall, than pay similar prices at Oriole, whose USP should be the coffee, but it isn't anymore."
"2595"|"statement"|"statement"|"I try to go in the afternoon when I can on a weekday."
"2596"|"statement"|"statement"|"I finally know why there is always a long line at the Marina Square link outlet and probably at other outlets too."
"2597"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had no idea what I ate exactly bc I was so drunk, but we ordered a combination of different dishes ranging from chicken curry to mutton briyani to mee goreng to prata."
"2598"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not a good value, by any means, and the XLB's where just about the same compared to the Arcadia location."
"2599"|"statement"|"statement"|"So then she goes on to say there isn't a manager on duty, and that she can relay our concerns when he comes back.... tomorrow."
"2600"|"statement"|"statement"|"2) Took a long time for coffee to arrive - This is where I know things go wrong 3) Ordered Avocado & Feta Smash - It was a slice of generic sourdough with a swipe of Avocado with a sprinkle of feta and some old mint leaves - they forgot my side order of a poached egg."
"2601"|"statement"|"statement"|"You can probably get just as good if not better food at an outdoor hawker centre, and the price would be more reasonable, but to do that you'd have to be a true local/insider to know where to go and what to order."
"2602"|"statement"|"statement"|"There are plenty of non sushi dishes too, if you have friends in the group who do not eat sushi."
"2603"|"statement"|"statement"|"The choice of single origin beans is a nice touch - when I visited, beans from Costa Rica and El Salvador were being served."
"2604"|"statement"|"statement"|"It might change every day because when I look at the Yelp photos, it appears to be different in each one."
"2605"|"statement"|"statement"|"I also ordered a chocolate ice cream, which they forgot to serve us, then when I mentioned this and asked for it in a take away container as we were leaving, they instead refunded me the $4."
"2606"|"statement"|"statement"|"But, do pay close attention to them when they are telling you which cats they have there is friendlier, and which are less ;) I managed to see 7 of them during my visit, you gotta look all over the places to spot all of them!"
"2607"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just don't expect too much when it comes to drinks and you'll be set."
"2608"|"statement"|"statement"|"There is a saying You get what you pay for."
"2609"|"statement"|"statement"|"The serving size can be small depending on what you order, maybe next time we get a pasta dish instead of meat and that would fill us up."
"2610"|"question"|"question"|"Maybe to avoid grumpy staff scolding you when they're busy, come for supper when it's less crowded?"
"2611"|"statement"|"statement"|"Go try it when you are in town!"
"2612"|"statement"|"statement"|"You can see what feels like the whole of Singapore."
"2613"|"statement"|"statement"|"Hazelnut Latte I  was quite stunned when I saw how big this cup was."
"2614"|"statement"|"statement"|"Without jumping in the kitchen, I'd say go have the big breakfast at Food For Thought to see what I mean by a good, even scramble."
"2615"|"statement"|"statement"|"they will deliver to your table even though it says self-service, i guess only when they arent busy."
"2616"|"statement"|"statement"|"For days when I am missing hummus and falafel, I would get the falafel wrap from Shiraz Mazzeh."
"2617"|"statement"|"statement"|"And this is not where the praise stops: the cocktail, recommended by the bartender, was simply amazing!"
"2618"|"statement"|"statement"|"One of the places I'll frequent when I'm craving one of the two."
"2619"|"statement"|"statement"|"Lawry's The Prime Rib, what more can be said about it."
"2620"|"statement"|"statement"|"The pulled pork and brisket were both tender and smokey and when added with the bbq sauce had great flavor."
"2621"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's my comfort when I'm ill or having no appetite for whatever reason."
"2622"|"statement"|"statement"|"Although they look like prawns or shrimp, they're shells are very similar to sea mantis where you'll need a pair of scissors to cut the underbelly to get the meat out."
"2623"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"And then when we were paying cash and sorting it out, he was like don't you think it'd be easier to put on your card?"
"2624"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've heard bad things from people who have gone for lunch and if your experience of Pollen involves slumming it with the tourists on the upper deck of the restaurant on the frankly, hideous garden furniture, then perhaps there is no chance of redemption."
"2625"|"statement"|"statement"|"You wouldn't want to come here, but it is very convenient when you are already in the building."
"2626"|"statement"|"statement"|"It got even better when our spoons hit the bottom of the pot, where burnt rice, or what we call guo ba (??), was clinging to the sides, just waiting to be scraped off."
"2627"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"That was when i called in... May?"
"2628"|"statement"|"statement"|"Here's the list of what we ate throughout the 4-hour dinner last night: -    Small Plate  Sweetbreads - with cabbage, granola and saltbush ($10)  Tripe (fried) - with tongarashi, Szechuan and caponata puree ($15) Chef's selection of charcuterie ($28) Crab - with uni, apple and asparagus ($25) Corn (roasted) - with spiced cheese, manchego and chives ($9) Kale (roasted) - with homemade cheese and nuts ($10) Burrata - with pickled tomato, basil oil and pine nuts ($12)  Cauliflower -with burnt butter tahini, piccalilli and dandelion ($10)  Main OP ribs - 1.2 kg of ribeye ($198) Iberico pork collar - with apple, nuts and mustard ($42) Roast chicken (half) - with beer sauce, house rub and black garlic ($22)  Dessert Chocolate salami - with salted caramel and chocolate meringue ($16) Figs - with yogurt ice-cream, nasturtium and Pedro ximenez sherry ($14) Popcorn - with corn and raspberry textures ($10) Chocolate tart - specials."

"2630"|"question"|"question"|"chicken rice or chicken wings? "
"2631"|"statement"|"statement"|"Nobody wants to be coated with Eau De Foodcourt after lunch time, if you know what I mean."
"2632"|"statement"|"statement"|"As the name suggest, the star at this small eatery is none other than the humble wan ton noodles, where a decent plate will cost you at most $3 in any hawker center in Singapore."
"2633"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not to mention, you'll be eating out on the streets where bugs actually feast on you as you feast on."
"2634"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't get why but Korean food is darn EXPENSIVE in Singapore."
"2635"|"statement"|"statement"|"One thing to note here, there's a Happy Hour promo from 5-8pm where beers on tap are $5 and all cocktails are $8."
"2636"|"statement"|"statement"|"Both good, and pretty close to what you can get in Georgia."
"2637"|"statement"|"statement"|"Right next to Robinsons there's the flamboyant M.A.C where I've seen one of the most helpful salesgirls."
"2638"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think expectation of what you're ordering definitely affects your satisfaction and they can make things clearer but the food is good."
"2639"|"question"|"question"|"I'd gone to Hong Leong building with the Girlfriend to catch a friend at a cheongsam shop, and while she was chatting, I figured I would look around for a place to park my bum - who knows how long girls chat for?"
"2640"|"statement"|"statement"|"After hearing such wonderful reviews about the Peking duck served here, I was deeply disappointed by what I had today."
"2641"|"statement"|"statement"|"Unfortunately, it's fast food that tries to be fresh but isn't really--don't get me wrong, it's not that the lettuce is wilting, but when you know that the char marks aren't real and the guacamole tastes like avocado juice from the Indonesian stall there isn't much that brings me back."
"2642"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's quite pricey but it is singapore so what do u expect."
"2643"|"statement"|"statement"|"All in all the food was decent but I think Monniker is a bit more style than substance, if you get what I mean."
"2644"|"statement"|"statement"|"I tried this place when I was in Little India because I heard they had clearly marked vegan options on their menu (and they do)."
"2645"|"statement"|"statement"|"But you will be happily slurping away when you get your ramen."

"2647"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"isnt it lonely out there? "
"2648"|"statement"|"statement"|"Customer convenience was not a consideration when they designed how to get into the store or to get around once you do get in."
"2649"|"statement"|"statement"|"They will only give you a table when most of the people in your party has arrived."
"2650"|"statement"|"statement"|"The Raffles Grill is an elegant fine dining room, while the Writers Bar continues to pay tribute to the novelists and travel writers who have become part of the Raffles Hotel legend."
"2651"|"statement"|"statement"|"It  was exactly what I wanted."

"2658"|"statement"|"statement"|"From what I have heard, the full-on buffet is not a regular happening, but on this day, there was a celebration in town (we went at the end of May), which was the partial reason for the buffet."
"2659"|"question"|"question"|"awesome ramen + unlimited water + perfect view overlooking clarke quayside.. what more can you ask for ?"
"2660"|"statement"|"statement"|"Like one of the reviewers below I would caution to watch what they're charging you for to avoid any surprise charges on your bill."
"2661"|"statement"|"statement"|"The normal loin in the katsudon was tough in comparison and hard to bite through, for those who prefer their meat to have more texture, the regular would be fine."
"2662"|"statement"|"statement"|"Drinks with selfies on the surface of your drink, what a concept."
"2663"|"question"|"rhetoric"|"Of all the delicious hawker centers + countless restaurants in Chinatown, why eat in a basement mall?"
"2664"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was .. different..  Not bad, but not what I normally expect of seared foie gras dish."
"2665"|"statement"|"statement"|"I walked here from where I stayed at in Clarke Quay."
"2666"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm so tired of going to restaurants when the server has no idea what's going on, takes 10 minutes to bring in an associate to explain, and this associate has no idea that I can spot bull all the way to KL."

"2668"|"statement"|"statement"|"He is proud of his crabs and you'd better order crabs when you're there."

"2672"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was less than $9 for the chicken katsu curry when I had it."
"2673"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is one of those places where you get a card at the door to rack up your bills in, and then pay upon exit."
"2674"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was filled with young expats, mostly from the UK from what I could tell from their accents."
"2675"|"statement"|"statement"|"Funny bc I'm currently the Duchess as I write this post, and the reason why I checked three times was because I purchased three Groupon vouchers."
"2676"|"statement"|"statement"|"This really soured the experience for me and this is why I left a bit early."
"2677"|"statement"|"statement"|"So, when a collegue read that Jar'd by Sarnies opened up, I was all for it."
"2678"|"statement"|"statement"|"Despite the busy lunch hour, we were seated and served super efficiently, to the point where the staff's enthusiasm and effectiveness was maniacally scary."
"2679"|"statement"|"statement"|"So when I heard about this place I made a beeline for it and headed down the same day."

"2681"|"statement"|"statement"|"As for the chicken sauce.. from BBQ to teriyaki.. to be honest, it tastes the same to me as both sauces are quite sweet.. other than that, it's quite affordable and what you pay for is what you get for the quality of the food."
"2682"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service here is pretty fast, and you pay on the spot when food is served."
"2683"|"statement"|"statement"|"Must definitely try the Tian Tian Chicken  Rice is you are in the area,  or when visiting Singapore."

"2687"|"statement"|"statement"|"Turns out, the host who seated us was very rude, almost as if he was uninterested in our patronage."
"2688"|"statement"|"statement"|"One tip for those who wish to patronize Suanthai - make sure you call to make a reservation because it does get especially crowded during mealtimes."

"2691"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is where you go for beer and huge portions--I've been told that their burgers and steaks are good, but I'm usually there for the finger food, having been scared off by a Cobb salad so large that two people (neither of whom shy grazers) could comfortably eat."
"2692"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just the same type of hot pot you can get anywhere in Singapore or just go at a time when there are not too many people."

"2704"|"statement"|"statement"|"Spizza is a really great place and i honestly don't understand why people wouldn't like this place."

"2710"|"statement"|"statement"|"I tend to find the soup a little too salty, and it os just a bit over priced for soup noodles when we have a lot of nice soup noodles to choose from."
"2711"|"statement"|"statement"|"Spice-wise, the dishes are tuned to a temperate palette, yet there were moments during the feast when I thought I was eating Indian briyani."

"2717"|"statement"|"statement"|"Touristy spot admittedly but still this place has become a usual spot for me when I want to bring a group to a chilli crab place that is more presentable place with AC and slightly better service."
"2718"|"statement"|"statement"|"This place is where many Hong Kong people come to buy pandan cakes and kueh lapis."
"2719"|"statement"|"statement"|"Well I lie actually, the true best part was when my team (Arsenal) won 2-0."
"2720"|"statement"|"statement"|"The only reason why Kilo did not earn 5 stars is that the portion sizes are really small."

"2722"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've been to other concert halls overseas and I can tell you that you really pay for what you hear over there."
"2723"|"statement"|"statement"|"For $20, the salmon mentaiko don was also overpriced and I would just be sticking to the drinks and happy hour deals when I next return."
"2724"|"statement"|"statement"|"We also felt that signature award-winning dishes were slightly overpriced, but what took the cake was definitely the liu sha bao, or salted egg buns."
"2725"|"statement"|"statement"|"Nothing over the top but another cool hamburger joint to eat in when you crave a big fat burger."
"2726"|"statement"|"statement"|"this ain't bashing, because this place isn't gourmet (and it knows it), but really - it's only good if you want something sweet and really can't care about what you have (because if you did, you'd head to patisserie g, just barely five minutes away)."
"2727"|"statement"|"statement"|"But I think it is going to be a pass for me next time when I am in town."
"2728"|"statement"|"statement"|"You get what you pay for."
"2729"|"statement"|"statement"|"Based on what I've seen on other diner's plates, the good people at Da Luca are very free with the quantity of food they provide."

"2735"|"statement"|"statement"|"Really do not know what had happened this evening."
"2736"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not a fancy place, but for all this food, and we paid about half of what we normally pay."
"2737"|"statement"|"statement"|"Then again, we sat outside so maybe thats why the audio wasnt good."
"2738"|"statement"|"statement"|"Red Chili Burger ($24) Beef patty, beef chili, cheese, jalapenos, French's mustard It looks kind of dry when served."
"2739"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is what I've learnt when I visited the bar on such a night at 10.30pm."
"2740"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was dying from hunger and it was only when I asked the waiter why 1/3 of our table got their food, did we realize there was some systematic course."
"2741"|"statement"|"statement"|"The band is too loud, can't even hear yourself thinking (and the blah staff can't hear you when you order."
"2742"|"statement"|"statement"|"Note that I'm not even pretending to be a wine expert at all - I just like to drink what tastes well (to me) and so far Argentinian wines did not disappoint me in any way."
"2743"|"statement"|"statement"|"Usually, I eat either black pepper crab or chili crab when I dine in seafood restaurants, but we had heard good things about the steamed crab at this place and decided to give this a try."
"2744"|"statement"|"statement"|"http://tinyurl.com/8vssstd  I am not sure why this restaurant isn't always packed."
"2745"|"statement"|"statement"|"The fiery buffalo wings will wake your pallets and when you can't stand the spice, just wash it down with more beer."
"2746"|"statement"|"statement"|"It is not at all clear how to order, there are no real menus, waiters, or explanation of  what the food is."
"2747"|"statement"|"statement"|"First of all, I ordered my steak rare and when it arrived it was everything but rare but I must admit, this was immediately corrected by the staff and they gave us a complimentary dessert so I will not hold that against them."
"2748"|"statement"|"statement"|"We went at about 5:30pm to beat the crowds and got a nice table--service was pretty good, our waitress was polite and only as attentive as necessary (we can't stand wait staff who are too pushy) so that was good because it allowed us to enjoy our mean uninterrupted."
"2749"|"statement"|"statement"|"It is pricey for what you are actually paying for."
"2750"|"question"|"question"|"Ever had a meal where you cannot find much fault, but that's the only great thing?"
"2751"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm regularly bewildered then, that Luke's is always so full that can't take reservations even when I'm calling a week in advance."
"2752"|"statement"|"statement"|"This tasted exactly how it would back in Thailand at the Erawan Team Room where I used to diner almost Every."
"2753"|"statement"|"statement"|"You will have to put an extra effort to hear on what the other person is saying even when he/she is sitting right across you."

"2755"|"statement"|"statement"|"Great to get when you are on the go."
"2756"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is where their true colors came out."
"2757"|"statement"|"statement"|"I also ordered the umeshu with rocks ($9) and was disappointed to see that the waitress only filled up 1/3 of the glass when served."
"2758"|"statement"|"statement"|"The wagyu beef was amazing as it was juicy and tender, however i thought that it was a little over priced when i got the whole set it came up to about $40."
"2759"|"statement"|"statement"|"Few ramen places can compare when it comes to the combination of both affordability and taste."
"2760"|"statement"|"statement"|"But I guess it's ok. L33 has a nice view, the service is nothing special but then again there are not many places in SG where I find service to be excellent."
"2761"|"statement"|"statement"|"My husband loved this place when it was at the other location and insisted we come check out the new location."
"2762"|"statement"|"statement"|"The most expensive lunch bento on the menu is $58, which is cheap compared to what I think is a like-for-like comp, Mikuni ($90)."
"2763"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is one of the better choices if you're spoilt for choice when it comes to hunting for some good Indonesian ayam penyet (smashed chicken rice) at Lucky Plaza."

"2768"|"statement"|"statement"|"The most extensive range of late night food you could probably ever find, and when you're tipsy, or tired, or happy, the food will still taste great no matter what."
"2769"|"statement"|"statement"|"The drink list is quite small and you can't even order all of the drinks( my fourth choice is what I went with ) ."
"2770"|"statement"|"statement"|"I am glad that they managed to preserve the stained glass from when this was a place of worship."
"2771"|"statement"|"statement"|"Been here twice, and have heard friends' reviews - lukewarm, but this place used to be so much better in 2009/10 when it was the new kid on the block (and not yet owned by a conglomerate, from what I heard)."
"2772"|"statement"|"statement"|"The owner is an effervescent man who used to work as a trader on both Wall St and in Hongkong."
"2773"|"statement"|"statement"|"Result was an improved juicier version of what I had."
"2774"|"statement"|"statement"|"The sandwich menu changes weekly depending on what's in season and what the chef feels like making, so there's always something new to try."
"2775"|"question"|"question"|"It is like when you need some comfort lovin'; have you ever rated it poorly at the end of it?"
"2776"|"statement"|"statement"|"Due to it look like a chopped up big hotdog texture but, it was not hotdog so I am not sure what it was but, it did not not taste like your regular pepperoni."
"2777"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was one of about 6 people in the restaurant at the time so maybe that's why service was so good."
"2778"|"statement"|"statement"|"Of course we could've ordered more, but this brings me to fourth: the prices are way too high for what you get."
"2779"|"statement"|"statement"|"It wasn't bad and it was better than expected but it won't make me order anything else other than the black cod when I visit Suju."
"2780"|"statement"|"statement"|"Located in the middle of the luscious green botanical gardens, Halia has glass windows where its patrons can periodically glance out to enjoy the gorgeous surroundings."
"2781"|"statement"|"statement"|"The place is located in a hidden place where one can enter through Uma Uma Ramen which is located above it."
"2782"|"statement"|"statement"|"I was curious about this place at first because they've managed to make their bar look like a hole-in-wall Japanese liquor shop when all their neighbours are striving for the opposite."
"2783"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service was average, staff seemed a unfriendly when we made requests, but remained polite."
"2784"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you are seated outside, as we were, it can be difficult to get the attention of staff who usually stay inside."
"2785"|"statement"|"statement"|"My friend commented that the Sakura Ebi was just a nice name for what we Singaporeans would usually refer to as Hay Bee though HAHA   The wait for the other two dishes was much longer,  but I was appeased when the Duck Confit arrived looking was absolutely delicious."
"2786"|"question"|"question"|"can i please have a different one...? "
"2787"|"statement"|"statement"|"Two of us sat at the bar area where you can watch the chefs prepare the food."
"2788"|"statement"|"statement"|"(No problem after spending a week in HK recently) Service is fast (she has 2 assistants) and you head to the side of the restaurant where there are metal chairs and tables aplenty."
"2789"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is the place I visit on the weekend, when I want to have a real coffee."
"2790"|"statement"|"statement"|"But I saw an expatriate lady who lost..and the staff very nicely gave her a second chance."
"2791"|"statement"|"statement"|"Whole duck was brought to our table where the restaurant captain did her magic, carving the crispy skin and then wrapped in thin crepe to be eaten with hoisin sauce."
"2792"|"statement"|"statement"|"Not much difference, depending on what you feel like having more."
"2793"|"statement"|"statement"|"The food is generally decent and what I think Swee Choon has going for her is: 1."
"2794"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is the place where the late Master Supreme Heavenly Chef Tham Yew Kai used to helm."
"2795"|"statement"|"statement"|"The French Onion Soup was very good, though quite pricey, but definitely the best french onion soup I ever had, unfortunately though that wasn't what  I really wanted."
"2796"|"statement"|"statement"|"At the side was a bowl of Japanese sticky rice, topped with crispy fried bits (of flour) the size of peppercorns - it was then explained that this was meant to be mixed with the broth when the noodles were finished, which I thought was the most fantastic idea!"
"2797"|"statement"|"statement"|"They couldn't have a better location: KGC is the de facto breakfast, lunch, dinner and supper spot for all who find themselves in the Arab St area at various times of the day."
"2798"|"statement"|"statement"|"I would have appreciate it if someone had bothered to explain why was our table was delayed and served us asap, but none of that happened, I wasn't even stopped when I walked out of the doors."
"2799"|"question"|"question"|"so where do you get char kway teow at 6am in the morning?"
"2800"|"statement"|"statement"|"The chips and guacamole are pretty good, and the 50 cent wings on Wednesday are what motivates my colleagues to take a short bus ride here for lunch."
"2801"|"statement"|"statement"|"Upon returning to work we devoured this delicious breakfast, with jealous glances and gasps from co-workers - I must say it lived up to the moniker good old taste, and now I understand why there is a morning line."
"2802"|"statement"|"statement"|"True blue fans of authentic Chinese cuisine like to complain, when they go to Western countries, about how inauthentic the food is."
"2803"|"statement"|"statement"|"and when you had enough of those aphrodisiacal oysters, exploring colony will lead you to greater pleasures!"
"2804"|"statement"|"statement"|"The staff there are generally curt but there is a nice uncle who was constantly looking out for us with a young infant."
"2805"|"statement"|"statement"|"I would come back but be sure to specify exactly what you want when making your appointment and be sure to call ahead!"
"2806"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just one small tip not to order what the host tried to push."
"2807"|"statement"|"statement"|"I love their Penang style prawn noodle that comes with a thick strong prawn stock and the fried kuay teow where you can actually taste the wok hei."
"2808"|"statement"|"statement"|"I came with a friend who just got back from the States for holiday and he was kind of missing this local fare."
"2809"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had to call twice at one point when the ice didn't arrive after 10 or 15 minutes, but after that they were always quick to fulfill the order."
"2810"|"statement"|"statement"|"Went to Potato Head for cocktail week 2016 and once the staff finally pointed us to the proper bar where we could order the drinks, everything went smoothely."
"2811"|"statement"|"statement"|"At least when it started."
"2812"|"statement"|"statement"|"mMm...it's simple, yet complexly delicious...and who can resist unlimited broth refills (yes, unlimited!)"
"2813"|"statement"|"statement"|"Don't say I never share where to bring your next date to!"
"2814"|"statement"|"statement"|"(Many others who showed up apparently did not do any reservations as well and managed to get a table like how we did)  Get the Crustacean Bowl - you have 2 option of serving sizes appetizer or main."
"2815"|"statement"|"statement"|"(order this baby and you'll know what I mean by red fingered')  No, the reason I stop in here as they really do have a nice selection of hawker stands, so you can have a Singaporean smorgasbord with little or no effort."
"2816"|"statement"|"statement"|"The lunch isn't so fantastic, very mediocre sandwiches that aren't warmed up enough even when you ask for it to be toasted, and due to the small kitchen, we waited close to half an hour for the sandwiches to be served."
"2817"|"statement"|"statement"|"you need more training "
"2818"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is is a little quirk of the Singapore craft scene, but you'll get what you get when you walk in the door and it all comes down to the supply chain which I have stopped trying to figure out, leaving it to smarter more determined minds like Frank's to unravel."
"2819"|"statement"|"statement"|"Each seating is about 2.5hours and when you make your payment at the counter on your way out, the cashier will also spray you with febreeze to freshen your clothes."
"2820"|"statement"|"statement"|"Prolly won't come back especially when there are better Italian restaurants (like Gattopardo) around."
"2821"|"statement"|"statement"|"For those who don't like raw food, would like more protein and dislike vegetables, the cooked meat rolls *look* delicious and helpings are generous compared to say SSB, your average supermarket sushi roll or the mass market restaurant chains."
"2822"|"statement"|"statement"|"They are most helpful only when you are about to order, and when you want to clear your plates."
"2823"|"statement"|"statement"|"this one from airpork "
"2824"|"statement"|"statement"|"Chicken was deboned which was nice but what failed this dish is that the waffle was extremely dry."
"2825"|"statement"|"statement"|"http://tinyurl.com/ag39gu9  Receipt ($489.63)  http://tinyurl.com/bys3jbk  Overall, Salt grill + Sky bar offers exactly what I expect from a true fine-dining experience."
"2826"|"statement"|"statement"|"Of course I can't remember (not very useful, sorry) what I got but there was a pretty strong stout that was really really good."
"2827"|"statement"|"statement"|"I decided to have breakfast here when I stayed at the hotel."
"2828"|"statement"|"statement"|"Staff are super friendly and helpful and willing to recommend things especially when they get to know you and your tastes."
"2829"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think if I have not tried Come Daily (especially when it was still fried by the father), I will rate this as very good."
"2830"|"statement"|"statement"|"We made a reservation for two on a weekday and when we arrived, the attendant promptly ushered us to a window seat facing out into the Regent's swimming pool."
"2831"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've heard mixed reviews about this place, but having a Singapore Sling here is apparently one of the things that one should do when they are in Singapore - much like having high tea at the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong."
"2832"|"statement"|"statement"|"Food- Most of what we ordered were the specials of the day."
"2833"|"statement"|"statement"|"No cakes or muffins as with what one would usually expect from a cafe."
"2834"|"statement"|"statement"|"Awesome drinks and what tops it for me is the vibrant , fun atmosphere."
"2835"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you're looking for a real deal hawker centre where the dishes are (way) under $6, then Tiong Bahru Market is your jam."
"2836"|"statement"|"statement"|"The menu was pretty extensive, I remember loving the beef short ribs the best, as they were so yummy and tasty when grilled on the BBQ."
"2837"|"statement"|"statement"|"I stopped by to try the bubble tea of this place for some Singaporean friends told me not to miss their bubble tea when in Singapore."
"2838"|"statement"|"statement"|"I myself would prefer summer berries, as someone who like fruits."
"2839"|"statement"|"statement"|"All were tasty, but I would say the baguette was most impressive especially because I had it when it had just come out of the oven  (still warm)!"
"2840"|"statement"|"statement"|"Poor attitude from manager who only looks up from his laptop to give you indifferent stares."
"2841"|"statement"|"statement"|"That was always daunting and explained why I hardly dined there."
"2842"|"statement"|"statement"|"Dont know since when the price has increased so much but it costed us around 15-20$/pax for a reasonable amount of basic soup + additional dishes."
"2843"|"statement"|"statement"|"Pretty pricey at $73 SGP, but when it's hot outside and you don't feel like leaving the comforts of the hotel and enjoy the fantastic service provided by the staff and can't get enough of the beautiful decor of this restaurant then this place is a no-brainer!"
"2844"|"statement"|"statement"|"And I should not have to wait 15 minutes for you to bring my bill, only to discover that you've brought the wrong bill, and then worry that you don't know what we ordered in the first place."
"2845"|"statement"|"statement"|"Let me repeat, NO MEAT, so meat eaters who shudder at the thought of only eating leafy greens, stay far away from this place."
"2846"|"statement"|"statement"|"The explosion of moist flavor from the bagels was really something i was not expecting, since what i ordered was actually quite dry."
"2847"|"statement"|"statement"|"You can have your coffee too supplied by Papa Palheta what a nice collab!"
"2848"|"statement"|"statement"|"From the outside the place looks deceptively small but when you walk in there is plenty of seating."
"2849"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is the first Timbre I went to back when I was still a teenager, and it's still my favourite Timbre!"
"2850"|"statement"|"statement"|"Lobster and foie gras paired perfectly with dense meatiness of mushrooms -JQ's Signature Roasted Crackling Suckling Pig with Yuzu pepper sauce had thin and crispy skins but what I didnt like was the underlying thick layer of fat that made the pork too rich to consume."
"2851"|"statement"|"statement"|"It is popular and was packed when I went there."
"2852"|"rhetoric"|"rhetoric"|"I also really wanted to try the Kaya toast there, and for $1.40 - why not?"
"2853"|"statement"|"statement"|"The chicken meat here was strangely drier than what I remembered from the robinson road and paya lebar square outlets."
"2854"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have no idea what he does to the chicken, but he skin and meat are incredibly moist and flavorful."
"2855"|"statement"|"statement"|"There is always a long line when I go, and then I'm very thankful for having made a reservation."
"2856"|"statement"|"statement"|"I taste the mondo mio signature pasta,and though I felt it was too pricey, when I did dig into it, the price seems rather fair."
"2857"|"statement"|"statement"|"I decided to try it here when I needed a place with no queue and served food fast."
"2858"|"question"|"question"|"can i eat pig liver in office? "
"2859"|"statement"|"statement"|"My colleagues and I troop down to this place to have drinks at 6pm when the drudgery of the day nears its end."
"2860"|"statement"|"statement"|"I think they may also have a system where you can get a text when your number is reached."
"2861"|"statement"|"statement"|"My husband loved craft beer so why not try Japanese craft beer."
"2862"|"statement"|"statement"|"I can't remember what exactly went inside it but it was just a little pretty pot of caramel goodness."
"2863"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"arent you glad that this is coming to an end? "
"2864"|"statement"|"statement"|"But you'll be so involved in what you're eating that I doubt it'll stop you from returning..."
"2865"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is where Gluttons Bay is not-bad for a group of friends to sit down and relieve their hunger pangs."
"2866"|"statement"|"statement"|"They had some really amazing smoked salmon, but their avocados did not seem fresh what so ever."
"2867"|"statement"|"statement"|"The queue was a bit longer when we left around 1."
"2868"|"statement"|"statement"|"As soon as I told the cab driver where my hotel was at, he initially said EAT AT THE FOOD COURT!"
"2869"|"statement"|"statement"|"Yuzu Pistachio logcake ($8.50++) is also another stunning creation where the nutty pistachio cream with plenty of grinded nuts are rolled in feathery light sponge and smeared with a tart citrusy cheese frosting."
"2870"|"statement"|"statement"|"If memory serves me well, this place was better a couple of years ago, when I last visited."
"2871"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"Just like bak kut teh, porridge is another one of those dishes where I'm all, Why the hell would anyone eat this when it's hot enough to fry an egg on the sidewalk?!"
"2872"|"statement"|"statement"|"yup, that's what they call it!"
"2873"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm a little late in the game when it comes to Royal China, but it's the one experience that led me to declare that no, not all hotel food is crap."
"2874"|"question"|"question"|"I'm on a quest to dessert my way through the lauded restaurants in this luxurious mall - these restauranters are meant to be at the top of their class, and what better way to test their prowess than through my favourite course of a meal (and the only reason I sit through the preceding courses)?"
"2875"|"statement"|"statement"|"I see thin airy layers as I tear them apart, flaky crumbs were scattering all around (less crisp than the ones at Tiong Bahru Bakery and not as overwhelmingly buttery), causing some mess when I try playdough-ing the structure."
"2876"|"statement"|"statement"|"Well Dressed is a great choice if you're in Chinatown and can't handle the food stalls where the locals go, behind the Buddha Tooth Museum."
"2877"|"statement"|"statement"|":)   To be honest, I've never actually ordered here, as I've always depended on my colleagues who speak Chinese."
"2878"|"statement"|"statement"|"But that's not why you came to Singapore, I hope."
"2879"|"statement"|"statement"|"With moderated expectations, I picked out a few good appetisers: the pork-and-cabbage dumplings (gyoza) were done crispily and firmly, and didn't disintegrate when I dipped them in vinegar."
"2880"|"statement"|"statement"|"CONCLUSION: If you ever miss Koreatown LA, you know where to go... 8 Korean BBQ."
"2881"|"statement"|"statement"|"They have the typical beers on tap (though I noticed that there was no Fosters - something that you practically find in every pub in London) but what I did like was the outdoor seating along the river."
"2882"|"statement"|"statement"|"We also made do with some roast pork and duck and washed it all down with what is now one of my favorite beverages in SE Asia:  Water chestnut drink."
"2883"|"statement"|"statement"|"The first which I notice when the dish was served, was that the pancakes were super thick in size."
"2884"|"statement"|"statement"|"Still when you do finally make it in, service is pretty prompt, and you can order off the various carts that get wheeled around, or off the menu."
"2885"|"statement"|"statement"|"that is when you know, for sure, she has arrived."
"2886"|"statement"|"statement"|"They chose to use chicken breast which can be awfully tasteless and dry when not prepared well."
"2887"|"statement"|"statement"|"The other reason that made me rate 3/5 was, the waitress was too quick to give our seats away when I missed to take their call."
"2888"|"statement"|"statement"|"I find this to be excellent price/value compared to what they charge at Brauhaus at Suntec."
"2889"|"statement"|"statement"|"That being said, the restaurant does look a lot classier than the one in East Coast, so I guess they're catering to a different crowd who doesn't talk to service stuff much."
"2890"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is definitely where the hippie minded go and i love it!"
"2891"|"statement"|"statement"|"So be careful when you take your first bite."
"2892"|"statement"|"statement"|"Wonderful service, good value for boat Quay, great ambience outdoors with the cool breeze from the river and we liked it so much we had our reception there when we got married."
"2893"|"statement"|"statement"|"They also have a few types of cakes on offer every day, the strawberry shortcake is delicious but i haven't seen it recently so I am still waiting for my lucky day (you never know what they are serving every day)."
"2894"|"statement"|"statement"|"The only response we got is, order what you like as what I recommend does not matter."

"2896"|"statement"|"statement"|"My joy was palpable when this joint recently opened a month or so ago."
"2897"|"statement"|"statement"|"A bit strange for dinner though, because the only times I've eaten rice porridge in the past was either: 1) when I was sick and my mother made it for me when I was little, or 2) after a night of clubbing the O.C."
"2898"|"statement"|"statement"|"Expect to pay up when you're here, but also expect good food in a lovely setting."
"2899"|"statement"|"statement"|"Having checked out their menu online, I was still undecided on what to order so we decided to seek the recommendations of our waiter."
"2900"|"statement"|"statement"|"Overall the service is average, they do provide you with extra lemon slices for your tea when asked but the real reason for going here is the location: this place is in the middle of MBS, which is one of the poshest malls in Singapore and you sit in the luxury circle surrounded by Prada, Louis Vuitton and others."
"2901"|"statement"|"statement"|"A bit of a letdown since fries are a personal vice that even when I crave lots of healthy foods is difficult to pass up."
"2902"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm an American who appreciates a good sandwich."
"2903"|"statement"|"statement"|"But would appreciate if the server could mention that they do have other coffees with milk if that's what I wanted."
"2904"|"statement"|"statement"|"The location is easy to get to, next to Bras Basah MRT and it is fairly spacious so good for larger groups, when checking the menu I was impressed by the range of different beans they offered."
"2905"|"statement"|"statement"|"I had brunch here once and I loved the concept of this place where they try to replicate breakfast meals of different countries such as American breakfast, English breakfast etc."
"2906"|"statement"|"statement"|"No that I'm complaining about the texture, but what bothered me was the additional Acar."
"2907"|"statement"|"statement"|"But of note are the high quality local staff who can communicate in both English and Mandarin, unlike some other restaurants."
"2908"|"statement"|"statement"|"This type of Burmese food is catered towards the Burmese workers who are laborers at the shipping yards nearby."
"2909"|"statement"|"statement"|"Set Lunch is made available where you get your carb fixed with a delectable sandwich - choose between: Baguette with Roma Tomatoes, Baguette with Tuna, Focaccia with Ham & Cheese or like myself, a Sourdough with Roast Beef."
"2910"|"statement"|"statement"|"The service has been good, a variety of wait staff, all who can help you and take your order, things do get a bit slow, but they do get slammed and busy."
"2911"|"statement"|"statement"|"Everything else like tempura and grilled items are the same standard as what you will find at Sushi Tei."
"2912"|"statement"|"statement"|"I probably eat 3 times what i pay for whenever i'm there for lunch."
"2913"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't know what else to say."
"2914"|"statement"|"statement"|"Often, I feel that I am back in Tokyo whenever I step into this restaurant where the clientele seems to be 70% Japanese and 30% Locals."
"2915"|"statement"|"statement"|"I am not above it but when you pay $25 and beyond you would expect a certain level of cleanliness and attention, at the very least maintaining the facilities in working order."
"2916"|"statement"|"statement"|"Apart from the tacky 60's d?cor and how they still serve their dim sums in pushcarts, that's where the similarities end with restaurants in Hong Kong as I feel their dim sum is overpriced and severely lacking in quality."
"2917"|"statement"|"statement"|"I'm a bit wary when it comes to flavors like these, which can quite easily go wrong."
"2918"|"statement"|"statement"|"But that is where the difference comes in."
"2919"|"statement"|"statement"|"And my husband gets grumpy when his favorite dishes are missing."
"2920"|"statement"|"statement"|"Eat what you want, give what you feel  Yes, Annalakshmi is THAT restaurant, the one that doesn't charge but leaves it to you to offer what you wish to."
"2921"|"statement"|"statement"|"They do coffee prepared every way you can imagine (pour over, press, aeropress, suction, you name it) so you get to try different ways to see what you like."
"2922"|"statement"|"statement"|"Restaurant Andre is in the list of top 50 restaurants in the world"
"2923"|"statement"|"statement"|"I've always passed by this place on a weekday night and wondered why they weren't open."
"2924"|"statement"|"statement"|"The patrons who eat there are true Singapore foodies looking for a great meal at an affordable price."
"2925"|"statement"|"statement"|"With so many tea-time, cake options it was hard to settle with what cake and what drink to have!"
"2926"|"statement"|"statement"|"They are also rather generous with their lard servings so for those who love those crispy pillows of lard, this stall would make you pretty happy."
"2927"|"statement"|"statement"|"But, you get what you pay for: cheap, mediocre Indian food."
"2928"|"statement"|"statement"|"The crust is what makes Tong Heng stand out."
"2929"|"statement"|"statement"|"Sure, it's not on the cheap side & can be out of the way for some folks, but here's why I like this place."
"2930"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was my mum who introduced us to this shop, and we have been coming here for more than 10 years."
"2931"|"statement"|"statement"|"Underneath the pork and the salad were a lot of unappetizing, deep fried potato cubes (tater tots) which made the dish much bigger than what it really was."
"2932"|"statement"|"statement"|"The hype over the locality of this place, an industrial space functioning both as a bike atelier and a cafe at the same time, Wheeler's Yard is a place where you can get unique bicycles while also having western food items and drinks!"
"2933"|"statement"|"statement"|"The restaurant is nicely decorated and set in a dim, candle-lit space, and the waiters carry a chalkboard over when you sit to enthusiastically explain their special menu for the day, and the house wines... it's fun!"
"2934"|"statement"|"statement"|"My first experience was to try their signature black pig shabu ramen and I must say I was very satisfied with what I had."
"2935"|"statement"|"statement"|"Also, if you do takeaway, don't take it personally when they call a number, you know it's not your order, but then they glare at you thinking it is your order, and then when you prove to them it isn't, they start yelling amongst themselves trying to figure out whether a guest isn't listening or if someone on the staff is an idiot for taking the wrong order."
"2936"|"statement"|"statement"|"The price is a little on the heavy side compared to the local street food, but you certainly get what you pay for (and comparatively from the US it's the same as regular [crappier] dim sum establishments)."
"2937"|"statement"|"statement"|"Firstly we had never been to this area, we were amazed, like a hidden gem, and so close to where we live!"
"2938"|"statement"|"statement"|"COFFEE BALLER ($8.50+) Macadamia Flavoured Espresso Ice Ball served with warm milk Beware of the hot milk when pouring into the glass."
"2939"|"statement"|"statement"|"Perhaps they are role-playing what it is like to have an executive office with a beautiful view in the future - after all that is what they are getting... And there are frequent bus loads of tourists who come trapping though the door."
"2940"|"statement"|"statement"|"However, when accompanied with the mango and mint chutney, the dish took on a Mediterranean taste."
"2941"|"statement"|"statement"|"Huge fish tanks in the back where you watch whatever you ordered get taken."
"2942"|"statement"|"statement"|"Along with the usual clothing, shoes, bags and what not, there are some trinkets and giveaways that you can purchase as well."
"2943"|"statement"|"statement"|"If downstairs is for the young at heart, this space is for proper grown ups... or those of us who like to at least pretend we are."
"2944"|"statement"|"statement"|"No matter what kind of meal you try, it's guaranteed to be wallet-friendly and delicious with well paired sauces."
"2945"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't know about you, but they don't have cat cafes where I come from."
"2946"|"statement"|"statement"|"Diners mark selections on a clipboard either while waiting for a table or immediately when seated."
"2947"|"statement"|"statement"|"It's a bit hidden (3rd floor of the SMU Admin building), but that's why it's so special."
"2948"|"statement"|"statement"|"Service quality was also more at the level of a 3*** hotel then what I would have expected from a hotel like the Raffles."
"2949"|"statement"|"statement"|"it's surprisingly casual though - where you might dress for a date with the sushi chef at aoki or tatsuya, this place is sartorially yummy-mummy-brunchy."
"2950"|"statement"|"statement"|"The ladies were pretty nice (we did laugh when our server told my fianc? he couldn't have sugar for his hot tea because it's not good for the body...she was totally serious)."
"2951"|"statement"|"statement"|"The one thing I will warn of though, and this is by no means a negative, is that when a dish is typically served with chilli in Thailand, expect it to be close to as hot as the Thais like it."
"2952"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just A-Ok.   To be honest, I don't know what Pompompurin is until a friend suggested we check this cafe located on the 4th floor of Orchard Central."
"2953"|"statement"|"statement"|"Pricing wise, it isn't sushi tei or sakae sushi, but what you're paying for is worth it."
"2954"|"statement"|"statement"|"Food for Thought does not charge for service, GST is already included in the listed prices so what you see on the menu is what you pay."
"2955"|"statement"|"statement"|"I would say it reminds me of the food in the old Hotel Phoenix which is also where Hotel Jen is occupying now."
"2956"|"statement"|"statement"|"We were wandering through the Club St, Ann Siang area late on a Sunday afternoon when we stumbled across the one restaurant that was actually opened at that time."
"2957"|"statement"|"statement"|"Nonetheless, my eyes instantly lit up when I saw the Daging Chabek Beef Cheeks ($34++), a hunky slab of meltingly tender meat with bits of fats and chewy tendon drenched in appetizing red tamarind Gula Melaka and coconut gravy."
"2958"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is where i fell in love with the Aburi style."
"2959"|"statement"|"statement"|"Located near at the whampoa wet market, this place might be difficult to find for people who don't stay in this vicinity."
"2960"|"statement"|"statement"|"There was a point in my life when I visited CUT monthly, because it was SOOOO GOOD."
"2961"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have tried Santouka's ramen at Clark Quay (ok, not impressed), Ajisan's (I'll only go back if I'm starving and the other shops are closed) and Mentai Japanese Noodles at Robinson Road (I still think this place's ramen is the best in Singapore)...so when my family decided to have lunch at Ramen Play... let's just say I'm not very excited because I'm not exactly a ramen fan."
"2962"|"question"|"rhetoric"|"That's why even though it was closed the first day I went (on a Thursday evening!?)"
"2963"|"statement"|"statement"|"I don't really know, I just cringe a little when I don't know, but I thought, what the heck, I'm already here."
"2964"|"statement"|"statement"|"He gave us a corner booth when I went there with my date for privacy, haha, and waited on us like it was a 5-star restaurant."
"2965"|"question"|"question"|"Menu does change from time to time but what won my heart was their sweetbread, foie terrine, bone marrow, and when was the last time anyone attempted fish quenelles?"
"2966"|"statement"|"statement"|"There were 3 women serving probably 50 diners at any time, which explains why when I asked for water twice, it came almost 25 minutes after I sat down."
"2967"|"statement"|"statement"|"I noticed many diners taking big scoops of the chilly oil, so I tried it to see what it's all about."
"2968"|"statement"|"statement"|"Overall the serving is quite huge and the two of us cannot finish it even thought we are both very hungry when we start eating."
"2969"|"statement"|"statement"|"We ordered and he asked what table number are we at."
"2970"|"statement"|"statement"|"Im in a different country where the majority of people here arent korean so you gotta deliver to the masses."
"2971"|"statement"|"statement"|"Thus I was extremely happy to walk in to this tiny shop, squeeze into some tight spaced tables to enjoy some really delicious dim sum, sharing my table with other strangers who equally enjoy their meal."
"2972"|"statement"|"statement"|"And where my dad brought me."
"2973"|"statement"|"statement"|"Lara has been very creative when comes to plating - pomegranates, black raspberry & floral petals, everything looks so whimsical."
"2974"|"statement"|"statement"|"If you're feeling too stuffed from the meal, you can always order this for take away and re-heat it using the office microwave when feeling peckish during the afternoon."
"2975"|"statement"|"statement"|"But when high-end restaurants such as Iggy's and Les Amis have no qualms serving tap water for free, not serving tap water irritates me."
"2976"|"statement"|"statement"|"First comes the Japanese and seafood section where you will see an array of cold crabs and sushi and soba and tempura too."
"2977"|"statement"|"statement"|"So, this place is truly for the sweet-toothed but only those who are fans of the great antioxidant - Matcha."
"2978"|"statement"|"statement"|"For $5.70 it is slightly pricey, but that's what we pay in town."
"2979"|"statement"|"statement"|"Just for kicks, we also ordered the huevos rancheros - that's what mexicans have for brunch and its made of scrambled eggs, refried beans, salsa, avocado and crispy tortillas."
"2980"|"statement"|"statement"|"I could pretty much say that so far Ippudo is the only ramen restaurant where I get my ramen craving fix in Singapore."
"2981"|"statement"|"statement"|"It is however also a lot of people who take the cupcakes and other pastries with them."
"2982"|"statement"|"statement"|"I really crave this on some days as it has the right amount of sweet sauce, duck, crispy crackers (not really sure what they call it - but it sure is tasty and crackle sin your mouth) and all served on a thinly crusted pizza."
"2983"|"statement"|"statement"|"Went on another occasion where I sat at the bar and had their whiskey sour with homemade almost syrup (can't remember the exact name) and was floored by how amazing it was."
"2984"|"statement"|"statement"|"Makes me feel so special (I guess that's probably why the servers could pay more attention to us)."
"2985"|"statement"|"statement"|"lim chee guan has since gone upmarket with an outlet in ion orchard and it is there where queues are somewhat sane and in aircon comfort."
"2986"|"statement"|"statement"|"Theoretically, what the breeder seek to accomplish is marry that wonderful beefiness of American beef, with the luxurious marbling of Japanese beef."
"2987"|"statement"|"statement"|"I mean thats why youre most likely going there."
"2988"|"statement"|"statement"|"It is similar to marche style where you are given a card at the entrance."
"2989"|"statement"|"statement"|"Temper your expectation as you are in a tourist attraction area where food is not the focus."
"2990"|"statement"|"statement"|"Given that the menu isn't labeled as such and our host was politely *not* eating his Sanger, I'm going to bluntly say the waiters should have used their brains and asked why our plates weren't moving."
"2991"|"statement"|"statement"|"I have explored some of these beers while in Japan but the craft beer trend was jot as strong when I was there so many of the ones on offer here were new to me."
"2992"|"statement"|"statement"|"After walking endless rounds I got tired and just ordered from the stall closest to where I sat."
"2993"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is the authentic wanton noodle store that used to be at Blk 7 where it was practically impossible to get a seat at."
"2994"|"statement"|"statement"|"That's really where Teppei shines, and frankly, I don't think I'll ever order anything else."
"2995"|"statement"|"statement"|"It was quite tasty with cashews and some other stringy ingredient (wasn't sure what it was)."
"2996"|"statement"|"statement"|"The line moves fast (possibly because Omnivore is still less known than DC), the assembly line is more organized (one person takes your order and money upfront, yells at the protein guy to cook your protein if its a steak, passes it to the legumes and veg lady, who passes it to the protein cutter who passes it to the packaging/sauce lady), food portions are HUGE (WOOOHOOOO!)"
"2997"|"statement"|"statement"|"and when it opened it's second outlet at cuppage terrace, some sanity prevailed and this outlet became my current go to joint instead."
"2998"|"statement"|"statement"|"We joined the queue and was amused as there were more and more people commenting how surprised they were to see such a long queue when the place hasn't even opened yet!"
"2999"|"statement"|"statement"|"To be honest, I am very surprised at how CZ manages to survive, what with its very low price point for an extensive Japanese buffet."
"3000"|"rhetoric"|"question"|"I knew what I'd be getting with the global chain but why not give the indie neighborhood cafe a try?"
"3001"|"statement"|"statement"|"The chicken rice was quickly served, but the first error was spotted when a dirty fork was given to me, I cringe at the very thought... disgusting."
"3002"|"statement"|"statement"|"This is what happens when the friend you're visiting is also a vegetarian."
"3003"|"statement"|"statement"|"Perfect for those who prefer clear soup rather than a thick, creamy broth."
"3004"|"statement"|"statement"|"I asked the lady at the counter (as I always do) for their recommendation, and was a little surprised when she pointed me to their simplest of plain croissants."
"3005"|"statement"|"statement"|"Santouka is consistently touted as one of the best ramen places in Singapore and its popularity was clearly evidenced by the queue that was forming when I went there for dinner."
"3006"|"statement"|"statement"|"Salmon tartare was very small and not at all worth the $22++ ...portion essentially what you'd get if it was served in a martini glass."
"3007"|"statement"|"statement"|"mains were comfort food which aren't really what I would want from a cafe."
"3008"|"statement"|"statement"|"For some reason, they're a little Chinese in the service sense where they won't take the time to make sure the customer is satisfied."
"3009"|"statement"|"statement"|"I wish I was as this seems to be one of Singapore's quintessential everyman hawker dishes (unlike the sexier chicken rice & chilli crab) but I'll be honest when I say that I find it difficult to distinguish quality between a good mee pok and a great one."
"3010"|"statement"|"statement"|"The pork was fatty but over-tenderised, good flavour but nothing more than what I'd expect from a coffeeshop tzi char place."
"3011"|"statement"|"statement"|"My mom and I were looking for a place to have lunch when she saw these teenagers holding plastic bags filled with take-away food, so we asked them where they got them from."
"3012"|"statement"|"statement"|"The store auntie who takes the orders has an incredible memory - no matter how many orders and combinations you give her, she always gets your order right, great because the queues can be quite incredible during lunch time - it takes so long because each order is individually cooked and so many people come here."
"3013"|"statement"|"statement"|"Thank you for at least a decent meal and it's very reminiscent of what I had when I was in Scandinavia."
"3014"|"statement"|"statement"|"Then slightly to the right, there are Teppanyaki & Robatayaki where you find monstrous grilled salmon fish heads, shishamo, baby tender chicken teriyaki sticks and grilled plumply shitake mushrooms."
"3015"|"statement"|"statement"|"I love Mexican food and this is why I do not love Piedra Negra."
"3016"|"statement"|"statement"|"First tip, make sure you refuse the peanuts and pickled veggies when you sit down if you don't want them."
"3017"|"statement"|"statement"|"Once dinner time is over,  LIB bursts to life in the later part of the evenings where djs take centre stage,  and Singapore's finest talents,  sometimes guests from overseas,  control the dance floor with their signature sounds."
"3018"|"question"|"question"|"next time I want to try Zhen Zhen porridge & the Chinese donut shop at the end  We came around 11am when not many of the stalls were open BUT there was already a line at Tian Tian (don't worry, the line goes quickly)  we definitely ordered WAY too much food for the 2 of us  --half chicken (steamed) --2 portions of chicken rice --oyster sauce flavored veggies  VERDICT?"
"3019"|"statement"|"statement"|"Pro-tip: ask him why he hates the Moscow Mule cocktail."
"3020"|"statement"|"statement"|"But the basement food area and the newly expanded section of the basement is where I spend most of my time."
